## **1. What Does Microbiology Do?**

- **Identify the infecting organism** (bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites). - diagnostics advice
    
- **Susceptibility testing** - determine **antibiotic resistance** to guide treatment.
    
- **Infection control** - identify **outbreaks** or clustered organisms in the community.
    

**Clinical Relevance:**  
Microbiology provides **critical information** about infection types and resistance patterns, enabling **targeted therapies** and **control of hospital-acquired infections**.

---

## **2. Laboratory Results and Their Role**

- **Diagnostic backup:** Laboratory results support clinical decisions.
    
- **Alert for suspected infections** not initially identified (e.g., **sepsis** confirmed via positive blood cultures).
    
- **Surveillance for outbreaks**: monitor circulating strains and resistance patterns.
    
- **Provide intelligence:** Guide **empirical antibiotic use** and **infection control** efforts.
    

**Clinical Focus:**

- **Sepsis management** often requires rapid microbiology results to guide treatment decisions.
    
- **Antibiotic stewardship** relies on understanding pathogen resistance profiles.
    

---

## **3. Why Clinicians Don’t Always Use Microbiology Results**

- **Time delay** between sample collection and result generation (infection progresses faster).
    
- **Complexity** of interpreting results (e.g., **Streptococcus oralis** vs **S. intermedius**).
    
- **Misunderstanding of microbiological data** – clinicians may not be familiar with **specific bacterial species** or their significance.
    

**Clinical Focus:**

- Understanding results like **blood cultures** can be challenging. Clinicians need guidance on interpreting **pathogens from normal flora**.
    

---

## **4. Roles of the Clinical Microbiologist**

1. **Provide diagnostic tests** for pathogens.
    
2. **Consultation service** for complex infections.
    
3. **Therapeutic advice** for serious infections (e.g., **empiric treatment** for septic shock).
    
4. **Infection control** within hospitals: **screening**, **outbreak management**.
    

**Clinical Relevance:**

- Effective microbiological consultations ensure **timely diagnosis** and **correct treatment** of infections, **reducing mortality** from conditions like **sepsis**.

## **5. How to Make a Microbiological Diagnosis**

### **Methods:**

1. **Direct examination:**
    
    - **Smears** (rapid, low sensitivity, requires expertise). - serology - test for a blood serum
        
    - **Cultures:** Grow organisms on agar, test for susceptibility.
        
    - **Molecular techniques:** PCR, **Next-Gen Sequencing** for fast pathogen identification.
        

**Clinical Focus:**

- PCR for rapid identification of **viral respiratory infections** (e.g., **Mycoplasma pneumoniae**, **Chlamydia psittaci**).
    
- **MALDI-TOF** mass spectrometry for bacterial identification.
    

---

## **6. Smear Diagnosis**

- **Advantages:** Rapid, simple, inexpensive.
    
- **Disadvantages:** Low **sensitivity** and **specificity**, requires expert interpretation.
    

**Example:**

- Gram staining of **blood culture** – quick identification of **bacterial type** but not all pathogens stain well.
    

## **Microscopy**

Light
- direct (stool - parasites)
- gram (CSF - bacteria)
- Z-N (sputum - TB)
- Giemsa (blood - malaria)
Fluorescent
- respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) diagnosis
Electron microscopy (EM)
- virus detection and identification

---

## **7. Culture Diagnosis**

- **Gold standard**: Most **sensitive** for identifying organisms.
    
- Allows **susceptibility testing** (determine best antibiotics).
    
- Disadvantage: **Slow growth**, cultures may be **rendered negative** if pre-treated with antibiotics.
    

**Clinical Focus:**

- Negative cultures can occur if the patient has been **pre-treated** with antibiotics before sample collection.
    

## **MALDI-TOF**
- positive step

- rapid identification of bacteria
- does not provide susceptibilities
- delayed by slow growth
- of no value if antibiotics render cultures negative

![[Pasted image 20251105112811.png]]
---

## **8. Serological Diagnosis**

- Detects antibodies or antigens to a pathogen.
    
- **IgM** and **IgA** for **acute infection**; **IgG** for **past exposure**.
    
- Detects **antigen** (e.g., **HIV**, **Hepatitis**).
    

**Clinical Focus:**

- **Serological tests** are important for diagnosing **viral infections** (e.g., **HIV, CMV**).
    
- **Titres** help track infection progress (e.g., **rising titres** for **rubella**).

### **Examples of serological techniques**
- Agglutination
- Precipitation
- Complement fixation
- Virus neutralization
- Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
- Radioimmunoassay (RIA)
- Immunofluorescence

---

## **9. Molecular Diagnosis (PCR, NGS)**

- **Rapid and specific** identification of pathogens.
    
- Highly **sensitive** and increasingly used in clinical diagnostics (e.g., **real-time PCR** for COVID-19).
    

**Clinical Focus:**

- **Molecular diagnostics**: faster **pathogen detection**, identification of **antimicrobial resistance genes**.
    
### **Koch based diagnosis**
- Slow and little changed from the time of Koch
- Many organisms do not grow on agar
- Specimens rendered negative by antibiotics
- Missed diagnosis
- Infection aetiology not understood
- Missing prognostic information

### **Examples of specimens**
- Urinary tract infection (UTI)
	- Midstream urine
- Wound
	- Pus or swab
- Meningitis
	- CSF & blood
- Pyrexia of unknown origin (PUO)
	- Blood for culture + serology
- Pneumonia
	- Sputum, lavage, serology

### **Specimens where only one pathogen is sought**
- Throat swab (except diphtheria suspected)
- Infection control screening
- Unusual infections e.g., pertussis
- Mtb detection

### **Specimens where a few organisms are likely**
- CSF
- STI samples
- Blood

### **Specimens with multiple pathogens**
- Faeces
- Abscess pus
- LRTI samples
- Oral swab
- (Urine) - as most patients are unable to obtain midstream

## **10. Sensitivity & Specificity**

- **Sensitivity**: Ability of a test to **identify true positives** (correctly detect infection).
    
    - **Formula**: Sensitivity = (True Positives) / (True Positives + False Negatives).
        
- **Specificity**: Ability of a test to **identify true negatives** (correctly rule out infection).
    
    - **Formula**: Specificity = (True Negatives) / (True Negatives + False Positives).
        
![[Pasted image 20251105114347.png|400]]
PPV = Positive predictive value
NPV = Negative predictive value

**Clinical Focus:**  
Understanding **sensitivity** vs **specificity** helps interpret diagnostic test results, especially in **clinical decision-making**.

### *Gold Standard* test. Itself is not fool proof but its the current best.

---

## **11. The Normal Flora and Clinical Results**

- **Normal flora** (commensals) can be **misinterpreted as pathogens**.
    
    - **S. oralis** may appear in **blood cultures**, but it’s part of normal mouth flora.
        
- Tests must be interpreted **in context** of the patient’s clinical presentation.
    

**Clinical Focus:**

- Is **Staphylococcus aureus** in blood culture **significant** or part of the normal flora?
    

---

## **12. Practical Example – Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) Diagnosis**

### **Empirical Diagnosis** (No Lab Test Required)

- **≥ 3 typical symptoms**: dysuria, frequency, urgency, etc.
    
    - **90% culture positive** → treat empirically.
        
- **≤ 2 symptoms**: Obtain **urine sample**, perform **dipstick test** (nitrites, leucocytes).
    
    - If negative, **do not treat**.
        

**Clinical Focus:**

- For **UTI diagnosis**, **dipstick tests** are commonly used to detect **nitrites** (bacterial conversion of nitrates to nitrites).
    
- **Urine culture** is reserved for uncertain cases.
    

---

## **13. Molecular Techniques in Pneumonia Diagnosis**

- **Real-time PCR** for rapid **detection of bacterial pathogens** like **S. pneumoniae** and **H. influenzae**.
    
- Faster results than traditional **culture methods**, crucial for **targeted antibiotic therapy**.
    

**Clinical Focus:**

- **Molecular tests** allow for **rapid identification** of pathogens in **community-acquired pneumonia** (CAP), reducing unnecessary antibiotic use.
    

---

## **14. The Future of Medical Microbiology**

- **Advances in rapid diagnostics** like **SLIC (Single-Locus Isolation Culture)** and **disk diffusion AST (Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing)**.
    
- **Real-time pathogen tracking** using **Next-Gen Sequencing (NGS)** and **molecular diagnostics**.
    
- **Faster, more accurate results** will improve **patient outcomes** and guide **antibiotic stewardship**.
