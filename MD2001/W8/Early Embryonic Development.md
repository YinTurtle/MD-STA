## **1. Overview: From One Cell to a Human**

Development relies on:

- **Cell proliferation** (mitosis)
    
- **Cell differentiation** (gene regulation + signalling)
    
- **Cell migration / adhesion / shape change**
    
- **Apoptosis** (e.g., finger web removal)
    
- **Invasion** (implantation)
    
- **Cell–cell communication**

## **2. Gametes**

### **Spermatozoon**

- Motile **male gamete** with head (nucleus + acrosome enzymes), midpiece (mitochondria), tail (flagellum).
    
- **Acrosome** enzymes digest **zona pellucida**.
    ![[Pasted image 20251104141055.png]]

### **Secondary Oocyte**

- Arrested in **metaphase II** until fertilised.
    
- Surrounded by:
    
    - **Plasma membrane**
        
    - **Zona pellucida** (glycoprotein coat – ZP3 receptor)
        
    - **Corona radiata** (cumulus cells + matrix)
    ![[Pasted image 20251104141108.png|600]]

---

## **3. Oogenesis & Ovulation (review)**

- Female born with ~1–2 million **primary oocytes** (prophase I arrest).
    
- At puberty → cyclic maturation; each month one completes **meiosis I**, forming a **secondary oocyte** + polar body.
    
- **LH surge** triggers **ovulation** of secondary oocyte (23 chromosomes).
    
- Oocyte captured by **fimbriae** and moved to the **ampulla** by cilia + peristalsis.

---

## **4. Fertilisation**

- **Union of haploid sperm + haploid oocyte → diploid zygote.**
    
- Usually occurs in **ampulla** of uterine tube.
    

### **Phases**![[Pasted image 20251104142525.png]]

Spermatozoon penetrates the oocyte in 3 phases.

1. **Capacitation (~7 h)** – sperm membrane modified in female tract → can pass **corona radiata**.
    
2. **Acrosome reaction** – enzymes digest **zona pellucida** via **ZP3 binding**.
    
3. **Membrane fusion** – one sperm enters; oocyte completes **meiosis II**.
    
    - **Cortical reaction:** oocyte releases granules that degrade ZP3 → prevents polyspermy.
        

**Result:** diploid **zygote (2n = 46)**.

🧠 **Exam Focus:** know the _three phases_ of fertilisation and function of **ZP3 + cortical reaction**.

---

## **5. Cleavage: Zygote → Morula**

- Rapid **mitotic divisions** without growth.
    
- Once the zygote has reached the two-cell stage, it undergoes a series of mitotic divisions, increasing the number of cells.
- These cells, which become smaller with each cleavage division, are known as blastomeres.
- **Blastomeres** (daughter cells) become progressively smaller.
- Once the cell reaches beyond 16, it is called **morula**
	
- Stages:
    
    - 2-cell (~30 h)
        
    - 4-cell (~40 h)
        
    - 8-cell (~72 h)
        
    - **Morula (16-32 cells)** by day 3–4, still within **zona pellucida**.

    ![[Pasted image 20251104143256.png]]
        
![[Pasted image 20251104142934.png]]
---

## **6. Morula → Blastocyst (Day 4–5)**

- **Inner cell mass (embryoblast)** → embryo.
    
- **Outer cell mass (trophoblast)** → placenta.
    
- **Fluid cavities** merge → **blastocyst cavity (blastocoel)**.
    
- When fluid accumulates and the zona pellucida degenerates, the **blastocyst hatches** ready for implantation.
- Blastomeres differentiate into embryoblast (inner cell mass) and single-layered trophoblast (outer cell mass)
![[Pasted image 20251104143511.png]]

---

## **7. Implantation (Days 6–9)**

- **Blastocyst** reaches uterine cavity on day 6–7.
    
- **Trophoblast** over embryoblast pole attaches to **endometrial epithelium**.
- Host-versus-graft and graft-versus-host reactions are normally suppressed
![[Pasted image 20251104143616.png]]
    
- **Trophoblast → two layers:**
    
    - **Cytotrophoblast (inner)** – cellular, mitotic.
        
    - **Syncytiotrophoblast (outer)** – multinucleated, invasive; secretes **β-hCG** to maintain corpus luteum.
        
- **Embryoblast** forms **epiblast + hypoblast** → **bilaminar disc**.
    
- **Amniotic cavity** appears within epiblast.
    
**On day 8:** the blastocyst is partially embedded in the endometrium of the uterus.
- In the area next to the epiblast, the trophoblast differentiates into the inner layer of cytotrophoblast, and an outer zone of syncytiotrophoblast (secretes beta -HCG)
- Small cavity appears within the epiblast called amniotic cavity
![[Pasted image 20251104144112.png]]

**By day 9:** blastocyst **partially embedded** in endometrium.  
**By day 10–12:** fully embedded; maternal blood enters **lacunae** → start of **uteroplacental circulation**.

---

## **8. Formation of the Bilaminar Disc (Week 2)**

- **Epiblast** (columnar cells) → future ectoderm + source of amniotic cells.
    
- **Hypoblast** (cuboidal cells) → lines blastocoel → **primitive yolk sac**.
    
- Together form **bilaminar embryonic disc** between amniotic cavity and yolk sac.
- Under the influence of fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) at the early blastocyst stage, cells in the embryoblast differentiate into epiblast and hypoblast cells
- Scattered cells segregate -> Bilaminar disc
![[Pasted image 20251104144128.png]]
![[Pasted image 20251104143844.png]]

🧠 **Exam Focus:** identify **epiblast vs hypoblast** and derivatives.

---

## **9. Primitive Streak Formation (Day 15)**

- Appears on **dorsal epiblast** (caudal midline).
    
- Establishes **cranial–caudal**, **left–right**, and **dorsal–ventral** body axes.
    
- Cranial end enlarges to form **primitive node** with **primitive pit**.
    
- Groove along streak = **primitive groove**.
    ![[Pasted image 20251104144227.png]]
    ![[Pasted image 20251104144238.png]]

- Cranial end of primitive streak is expanded and called the primitive node, which contains primitive pit
- Primitive streak has a groove called primitive groove
![[Pasted image 20251104144318.png]]
---

## **10. Gastrulation → Trilaminar Disc (Day 16)**

- **Epiblast cells** migrate through **primitive streak**, invaginate, and displace hypoblast.
    
    - First-migrating cells → **definitive endoderm**.
        
    - Next layer → **intra-embryonic mesoderm**.
        
    - Remaining surface epiblast → **ectoderm**.
        
- Cells of the epiblast migrate through the primitive streak, detach from the epiblast, displace hypoblast and create a third layer **(invagination)**
→ Formation of **three germ layers**:  
**Ectoderm**, **Mesoderm**, **Endoderm**.
![[Pasted image 20251104144435.png]]

**Clinical Focus:** errors in gastrulation → midline defects (e.g. sacrococcygeal teratoma from persistent primitive streak).
![[Pasted image 20251104144451.png]]
---

## **11. Notochord Formation (Days 16–18)**

- Cells from **primitive node** form **notochordal process** → **notochordal plate** → **notochord** (solid rod).
![[Pasted image 20251104144757.png]]
    
- Formation proceeds **cranial → caudal**.
    ![[Pasted image 20251104144828.png]]
- **Notochord functions:**
    
    - Defines **embryonic midline & axis**.
        
    - Induces **neural tube** formation (neurulation).
    - Activates a signalling pathway involved in tissue differentiation and development (maintain the body's shape during early development, neural tube, somites)
        
    - Later forms **nucleus pulposus** of intervertebral discs.
    ![[Pasted image 20251104145107.png]]
- Because these events occur in a cranial-to-caudal sequence, notochord is first formed near the cranial region
- Notochord activates a signalling pathway involved in tissue differentiation and development
![[Pasted image 20251104145001.png]]

🧠 **Exam Focus:** sequence – node → process → plate → notochord.

## **13. Ectopic Pregnancy**

- **Abnormal implantation** of blastocyst outside uterine cavity.
- In the ovary or anywhere along the path of migration into the uterine cavity
- Placenta can form on most tissues or structures
    
- Sites:
    
    - **Tubal (≈95 %)** – ampulla or isthmus.
        
    - **Ovarian, cervical, abdominal** – rare.
        
![[Pasted image 20251104145432.png]]
**Clinical implications:**

- **Tubal rupture + haemorrhage** (2nd–5th month) → maternal mortality risk.
    
- Sometimes causes **tubal abortion** (spontaneous loss).
- Can cause maternal mortality if undetected after intraperitoneal rupture of the uterine tube and its vessels
    

🩺 **Clinical Focus:** β-hCG positive, but **empty uterus on ultrasound** suggests ectopic implantation.

## **14. Cytoplasmic Donation (optional slide)**

- Experimental; involves **pronuclear transfer** in fertilised ova (not required for exam).
