## **1. Lipid Bilayer & Selective Permeability**

- The **lipid bilayer** is a **selectively permeable barrier** to substances.
    
- **Intrinsic proteins** (channels, carriers) facilitate specific molecular transport across the membrane.
    
- **Permeability** is influenced by:
    
    - Molecular size
        
    - Lipid solubility
        
    - Polarity
        
    - Membrane thickness
        

**Clinical Focus:**

- **Membrane defects** or abnormal protein function (e.g., **cystic fibrosis** - defective chloride channels) can impact cellular function and lead to disease.

## **2. Transport Across Membranes**

### **Diffusion**

- Movement of substances **down their concentration gradient**.
    
- **No energy required**.
    
- Occurs through **lipid bilayer** (lipid-soluble) or via **protein channels** (water-soluble).
    
- **Passive transport**: Simple diffusion or facilitated diffusion.
![[Pasted image 20251105121732.png]]
- Symport = same direction of substances
- Antiport = opposite direction of substances

### **Active Transport**

- Movement **against a concentration gradient**, requiring **energy (ATP)**.
    
- **Primary active transport**: directly uses ATP (e.g., Na+/K+ pump).
    
- **Secondary active transport**: uses the electrochemical gradient generated by primary transport.
    

---

## **3. Passive Transport**

### **Simple Diffusion**

- Occurs through the **lipid bilayer**; depends on the **concentration gradient** (ΔS = [S]outside - [S]inside).
    
- The rate is proportional to the **permeability coefficient (P)** and concentration difference.
![[Pasted image 20251105122635.png]]
    
    > Rate of diffusion ∝ P * ΔS
    
- **Solubility in lipid** is a key factor — more lipid-soluble substances (e.g., **O₂**, **CO₂**) diffuse faster.
    

![[Pasted image 20251105122433.png]]

V$_{inward}$ = PΔS
V$_{inward}$  = rate of diffusion into cell (moles/sec/cm$^2$ of membrane)

P = permeability coefficient

Depends on thickness and viscosity of membrane and size, shape, polarity and solubility in membrane of substrate - constant for a particular system.
![[Pasted image 20251105123327.png]]

Partition coeficient gives a measure of how well a substance dissolves in lipid or aqueous phase.

e.g. Shake the substance with a mixture of oil and water, allow to settle and measure the concentration of the substance in the oil and water

## **Rate of transport through lipid phase of membrane**

![[Pasted image 20251105123624.png]]
The more lipid there are, the less polar it is, therefore it is able to pass through the membrane because of the phospholipid membrane. 


### **Water Transport – The Anomaly**

- **Water** moves across membranes **much faster than expected**.
    
- Water molecules pass through specific protein channels called **aquaporins (AQPs)**.
    
- **Aquaporins** discovered in 1992, resolve the water transport anomaly in cells like **RBCs** and **kidney cells**.
    

**Clinical Focus:**

- **Aquaporins** (e.g., **AQP1, AQP2**) are crucial in **kidney water reabsorption**. Dysfunction or mutations in aquaporins can lead to **diabetes insipidus** (ADH-related), where water balance is impaired.
    

---

## **4. Aquaporin Channels**

- **13 types of aquaporins** in the human body, each regulating water flow in different tissues (e.g., kidney, brain, RBCs).
    
- Aquaporins form **tetramers**, with each monomer forming a water channel.
    
- **Selective permeability**: Only **water molecules** pass, as **hydrated ions** are too large.
    
    - **Narrow pore (~2.8 Å)** only allows single-file passage of water molecules.
        

**Clinical Focus:**

- **AQP2** regulation by **ADH** in the kidneys controls **water reabsorption**. In conditions like **SIADH** (Syndrome of Inappropriate ADH Secretion), excess water retention can occur.
    

---

## **5. Membrane Transport Mechanisms**

### **Protein Channels**

- **Ion channels** allow selective **ion transport** (e.g., Na⁺, K⁺).
- Some channel are gated and always open
    
- Channels can be **gated**:
    
    - **Voltage-gated** (e.g., Na⁺ channels in neurons).
        
    - **Ligand-gated** (e.g., neurotransmitter receptors).
        
- **Selective** for specific ions, **size**, and **charge**.
    

**Clinical Focus:**

- **Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)** is a chloride channel. Mutations lead to **thick mucus** and respiratory issues in **cystic fibrosis**.
    

## **Example of voltage gated channel - sodium channel**
The sodium channels are lined with negatively charged amino acids that pull the sodium ion away from its shell. The smaller unhydrated sodium ion  can then diffuse through the channel.

Unhydrated potassium ions are too large. K+ uses another channel.
![[Pasted image 20251105124746.png]]

### **Potassium Channel**
Carbonyl oxygens (C=O) in the selectivity channel strip water molecules from the potassium but not the sodium molecule. So only potassium ions can permeate.

## **6. Facilitated Diffusion (Carrier-Mediated Transport)**

- Involves a **carrier protein** that **binds** to the molecule to transport it across the membrane.

- Facilitated diffusion, 'down" a conc gradient.
- Active trans - up (against a conc gradiant) see later.
	- 'In both cases, substance binds onto a specific carrier -> conformational change -> transports the substance
    
- **Saturable**: Transport rate reaches a **Vmax** when all carriers are occupied.
	- This transport can saturate - limited binding sites and it takes time for transport to occur.
    
- **Example:** Glucose transport via **GLUT** proteins in tissues.

- Rate of diffusion is limited by Vmax of carrier protein
![[Pasted image 20251105125152.png]]

**Exam Focus:**

- **Vmax** in facilitated diffusion limits transport rate. Understand how this relates to **carrier saturation**.

## **7. Active Transport**

- **Primary Active Transport:** Direct **ATP hydrolysis** (e.g., **Na+/K+ ATPase** pump).
    
    - Maintains **Na⁺/K⁺ gradients**: 3 Na⁺ out, 2 K⁺ in.
        
    - **ATP** used to push ions **uphill** against their concentration gradients.
        
- **Secondary Active Transport:** Uses the **electrochemical gradient** created by primary transport (e.g., **Na+/glucose symporter**).
    
    - **Symport**: Molecules move **in the same direction** as Na⁺.
        
    - **Antiport**: Molecules move **opposite** Na⁺ (e.g., Na⁺/Ca²⁺ exchanger).
        

**Clinical Focus:**

- **Sodium-potassium pump** uses 60–70% of **ATP** in neurons and muscle to regulate volume, resting potential, and electrical excitability.
    

---

## **8. Primary Active Transport – Na+/K+ Pump**

- Key in maintaining **cellular ionic gradients**:
    
    - **3 Na⁺ out** / **2 K⁺ in**.
        
- **Energy use**: Hydrolysis of **ATP** provides energy to transport ions against their gradients.
    
- **Key functions:**
    
    - **Control cell volume** (osmotic regulation).
        
    - **Electrical potential** (essential for **action potentials** in excitable cells).
        

**Clinical Focus:**

- **Digitalis (digoxin)** inhibits the **Na+/K+ pump** → **Na⁺ retention** → affects **cardiac action potentials** and can be used to treat **heart failure**.
    

---

## **9. Secondary Active Transport**

- Uses **Na⁺ gradient** generated by **Na+/K+ ATPase** to move other molecules **uphill**.
    
    - **Example:** **Na+/glucose symporter** (glucose uptake in intestines, kidneys).
        
    - **Symporters** move substances in the **same direction** as Na⁺.
        
    - **Antiporters** move substances **opposite** Na⁺ (e.g., **Na+/Ca²⁺ exchanger**).

---

## **10. Movement Through Sheets (e.g., Epithelium)**

- **Active transport** across one membrane (e.g., **intestinal epithelium**).
    
- **Diffusion or facilitated diffusion** across the opposite membrane.
    
    - Example: **Sodium transport** across intestinal epithelial cells, followed by **glucose** or **water** reabsorption.
        

**Clinical Relevance:**

- **Cystic fibrosis** affects chloride transport, leading to **abnormal epithelial transport** and **thick mucus**.
    
- **Diarrhoeal diseases** can affect **Na⁺/glucose transport** in intestinal cells.

![[Pasted image 20251105125727.png]]
Occurs in e.g.,
- intestinal epithelium epithelium of the renal tubules epithelium of all exocrine glands epithelium of the gallbladder membrane of the choroid plexus of the brain, along with other membranes Mechanism: (1) active transport through the cell membrane on one side of the transporting cells in the sheet (2) either simple diffusion or facilitated diffusion through the membrane on the opposite side of the cell
