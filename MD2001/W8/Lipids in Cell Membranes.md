## **1. What Are Lipids?**

- Organic molecules with **low solubility in water** (hydrophobic nature).
    
- Major types:
    
    - **Phospholipids**
        
    - **Fats / Fatty acids**
        
    - **Sterols (e.g., cholesterol)**
        
    - **Some vitamins (A, D, E, K)**
        

**Functions of Lipids**

- Long-term **energy storage** (fatty acids, triglycerides).
    
- **Structural role** – main component of biological membranes.
    
- **Cell signalling** – act as messengers and precursors (e.g., steroid hormones).
    

---

## **2. Fatty Acids**

- **Basic structure:** carboxylic acid with a long hydrocarbon chain  
    → CH₃(CH₂)₄₋₂₄COOH
    
- Even number of carbon atoms.
    
- Usually **not free** – attached to glycerol, cholesterol, or proteins (e.g. bound to albumin).
- Short and medium chain fatty acids can be absorbed into the blood stream.
- Long chain fatty acids cannot and are synthesised
    

| Type                    | Example      | Notation | Description            |
| ----------------------- | ------------ | -------- | ---------------------- |
| **Saturated**           | Stearic acid | 18:0     | No double bonds        |
| **Unsaturated (cis)**   | Oleic acid   | 18:1Δ9   | 1 double bond (kinked) |
| **Unsaturated (trans)** | Elaidic acid | 18:1     | Linear, less healthy   |

**Nomenclature:**

- Number of carbons : double bonds ratio
	- 16:0 saturated
	- 18:1 unsaturated
	- 20:4 polyunsaturated
    
- Δ (delta) numbers double-bond position from **carboxyl end**.
	- e.g. Δ5, Δ8, Δ11, Δ14
	- ![[Pasted image 20251104101425.png]]
    
- **Polyunsaturated FAs** – double bonds separated by –CH₂– units.
    
- **Omega (ω)** notation – double-bond position counted from **methyl end** (e.g. ω-3, ω-6).
    

**Clinical Focus:**  
Abnormal FA metabolism contributes to cardiovascular and inflammatory disease.

---

## **3. Sterols**

- Include **cholesterol**, **bile acids**, **steroid hormones**, **vitamin D**.
    
- **Functions:**
    
    - Regulate membrane **fluidity and permeability**.
        
    - Serve as **precursors** for hormones and bile salts.
        

**Clinical Link:**  
Inherited enzyme defects in lipid degradation (lipidoses):

- **Gaucher’s disease** (most common)
    
- **Niemann-Pick**, **Tay-Sachs**, **Fabry**  
    → Lipid accumulation in neurons, liver, spleen, bone marrow → failure to thrive, neurological symptoms.

## **4. Lipids in Biological Membranes**

### **Main Membrane Lipids**

1. **Phospholipids** – most abundant.
    
    - Glycerol backbone + phosphate head + fatty acid tails.
        
    - Common head groups: **choline** (most common), **ethanolamine**, **serine**, **inositol**.
        
2. **Glycolipids** – contain a **sphingosine core** + carbohydrate group.
![[Pasted image 20251104102026.png]]
    
3. **Sterols (cholesterol)** – intercalate between phospholipids, modulating fluidity.

![[Pasted image 20251104101805.png]]

### **Amphipathic Nature**

- Lipids have:
    
    - **Hydrophilic (polar) head** – interacts with water.
        
    - **Hydrophobic (non-polar) tails** – avoid water.
        
- This dual nature drives **spontaneous bilayer formation** in aqueous environments.
    

---

## **5. The Lipid Bilayer**

- **Hydrophilic heads** face outward to aqueous environment.
    
- **Hydrophobic tails** face inward, forming a non-polar core.
    
- Provides **semi-permeable barrier** to ions and polar molecules.
- Energetically favourable conformation
 ![[Pasted image 20251104102236.png]]
    

**Key Roles:**

- **Compartmentalisation** (organelles, cytoplasm).
    
- **Selective permeability** for controlled transport.
    
- **Cell communication** – surface receptors and signal transduction.
    
- **Dynamic interface** – membranes are flexible and self-sealing.
    

---

## **6. Fluid Mosaic Model (Singer & Nicolson, 1972)**

- Membrane is a **fluid, two-dimensional matrix** (can only follow the direction of the membrane).
    
- Lipids and proteins move **laterally and rotationally** (rarely flip-flop).
    
- Proteins “float” in the lipid sea.
    
- Two classes of proteins:
    
    - **Integral (intrinsic)** – span or embed in bilayer.
        
    - **Peripheral (extrinsic)** – loosely attached to surfaces via electrostatic or hydrogen bonds.
        

**Membrane Fluidity Depends On:**

- **Temperature** – higher T → more fluid.
    
- **Fatty acid saturation** – more unsaturated = more fluid.
    
- **Cholesterol content** – buffers fluidity (stabilises at high T, prevents freezing at low T).
    
![[Pasted image 20251104102541.png]]

**Experimental Evidence:**  
Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) demonstrates lateral lipid mobility - measure membrane fluidity.

## **7. Membrane Asymmetry**

- **Inner and outer leaflets differ in lipid composition.**
    
    - Outer: phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin.
        
    - Inner: phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine.
        
- **Asymmetry maintained by flippases** (enzymes moving lipids between leaflets).
    
    - Synthesised at ER cytosolic face → flipped to other side.
        
    - Some flippases are **selective**, creating leaflet-specific lipid distributions.
        

**Exam Focus:**  
Be able to state which lipids dominate each leaflet and how asymmetry arises.

---

## **8. Membrane Formation & Transport**

- **Synthesis:** new phospholipids made in **endoplasmic reticulum (ER)**.
    
- Transferred via **vesicular trafficking** to Golgi → plasma membrane.
    
- **Exocytosis:** vesicles fuse with cell membrane → add new lipids/proteins + secrete contents. Allows movement of other molecules out of cell.
    
- **Endocytosis:** vesicles bud inward → internalise materials (receptor-mediated uptake, immunity). Important in immune response.
    ![[Pasted image 20251104103248.png]]

---

## **9. Lipid Rafts**

- Microdomains enriched in **cholesterol**, **sphingolipids**, and **specific proteins**.
    
- Function as **organising centres** for:
    
    - Vesicle trafficking
        
    - Signal transduction
        
    - Membrane sorting
        

---

## **10. Membrane Proteins – Overview**

Most molecules cannot diffuse through lipids → require proteins for **transport (active/passive) or signalling**.

|Protein Type|Example / Function|
|---|---|
|**Integral / Transmembrane**|Channels, carriers, receptors|
|**Peripheral**|Cytoskeletal anchors, enzymes|
|**Lipid-linked**|GPI-anchored proteins (outer leaflet)|
|**Protein-attached**|Interact via adaptor proteins (e.g. G-protein complexes)|
![[Pasted image 20251104103842.png]]
---

### **Integral (Transmembrane) Proteins**

- Span the bilayer with **hydrophobic transmembrane domains**.
    
- Act as **pores, channels, carriers, or receptors**.
    
- Example: ion channels, glucose transporters, GPCRs.
    

---

### **Peripheral Proteins**

- Bound to membrane surfaces by **non-covalent interactions**.
    
- Often participate in **signal cascades** or **structural scaffolding**.
    

---

### **Lipid-Linked Proteins**

- Covalently attached to lipids such as **GPI (glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol)**.
    
- Localised to **outer leaflet**.
    
- Important for **anchoring and signalling** (e.g., alkaline phosphatase).
    
![[Pasted image 20251104104343.png]]
The protein is closer to the surface.

---

### **Protein-Attached Proteins**

- Bind indirectly via **membrane-bound partners**.
    
- Key in **signal transduction complexes** (e.g. β₂-adrenergic receptor–G-protein).
![[Pasted image 20251104104504.png]]

---

### **Membrane-Associated Domains**

- Many proteins have **lipid-binding domains** (e.g., **PH domains**) that target specific phospholipids.
    
- These domains determine **compartment specificity** (cytoplasmic vs nuclear membranes).
