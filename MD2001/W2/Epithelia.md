### *What are epithelia/ is an epithelium?*

- Epithelial cells form tissue - an epithelium
- One of four tissue types: 
	- epithelial
	- nervous
	- muscle
	- connective
- Many variations of epithelial tissue
	- Structure (cell shape)
	- Layers
- The structure of an epithelium relate to and enables its function

- Epithelia form a continuous sheets of cells
- Heterogenous cell types
	- specialized for distinct functions
		- e.g. airway epithelium, kidney epithelium
- It can act as barriers:
	- between the body and the external world
	- between fluid compartments within the body
- It acts to transport molecules via
	- Absorptive processes
		- Such as the kidney
		![[Kidney epithelium example.png]]
	- Secretory processes
		- Such as the lumen of the airway
		![[Airway epithelium example.png]]
- Summary:
	- Epithelial cells form a tissue - an epithelium
	- Different types of epithelial cells enable different functions
	- Epithelial cells act as a barrier
	- Epithelial cells enable transport of molecules
		- Absorption
		- Secretion

### *Epithelial Cells - Structural Features*

Epithelial cells have unique structural features:
- Junctional proteins
	- Connect cells to each other
	- Connect cells to basement membrane
	- Some allow intercellular communication e.g. transport of ions
	- Enable polarisation
![[Polarisation of Epithelial Cells.png]]

### *Epithelial cells - Junctional Complexes*

![[Epithelial cells - Junctional Complexes.png]]

#### *Tight Junctions*
- Also known as "Zonula Occludens"
- Most apical junction
	- branching network of strands or proteins
	- "zipper" together neighbouring epithelial cells
- Defines apical/basolateral boundary
	- Prevent passage of molecules and ions
	- Permeability barrier - "gatekeeper" of the paracellular pathway

![[Tight Junctions Epithelium.png]]

#### *Adhering Junctions*
- Also known as "Zonula Adherens"
- More basal than tight junctions
- A "belt" that encircles epithelial cell directly beneath the tight junction
	- Allow cell to cell adhesion via interaction between extracellular domains
	- Connect intracellularly to the actin cytoskeleton

![[Adhering Junctions Epithelium.png]]

#### *Desmosomes*
- Also known as "Macula Adherens"
- Spot like adhesions arranged on the lateral surface of cells
- Allow cell to cell adhesion via interaction between extracellular domains
- Intracellular cytoplasmic tail associates with adaptor and signalling proteins

![[Desmosomes Epithelium.png]]

#### *Epithelial Cells - Junctional Complexes*

![[Junctional Complexes Example.png]]

### *Gap Junctions*
- Lateral edges of epithelial cells, allow intercellular communication
	- Permeable to large molecules equal or smaller than 1 kDa
		- Ions, metabolites, signalling molecules
	- Permeability of GC varies between cells and can change in response to stimuli
- Not specific to epithelial cells, nearly all cells have gap junctions
- Consists of 2 connexons, one from each cell, each formed of 6 connexin subunits

![[Gap Junctions Epithelium Example.png]]

#### *Hemidesmosomes*
- Localised to the basal surface
	- Attach epithelial cells to the basement membrane (rather than to an adjacent cell)
	- Stud-like structure
- Membrane-spanning proteins
	- Integrins

![[Position of Hemidesmosomes (HD).png]]

### *Structural Features - Microvilli*
- Apical surface area can be increased by presence of a "brush border membrane"
	- Microvilli
	- Proximal tubule of kidney, small intestine
	- Enables absorption (up to 20x greater surface area)

![[Microvilli Diagram.png]]
![[Examples of microvilli.png]]

### *Basolateral Surface*
- Basolateral surface area can also be increased by:
	- Lateral Interdigitations
	- Basal Infoldings
- Important for transport across the epithelial layer
- Particularly seen in basolateral surface

![[Basolateral surface Epithelium (renal).png]]

### *Cilia*
- Cilia also present on apical surface of some epithelia
- Longer/larger than microvilli
- Cilia move back and forth to move particles
	- Ciliated cuboidal/columnar:
		- Oviduct (though non-ciliated secretory epithelium here also)
	- Pseudostratified columnar:
		- Respiratory tract (lower larynx, trachea, bronchi)
		- Vas deferens, epididymis

![[Cilia in Cuboidal, Columnar and Squamous.png]]
![[Cilia vs. microvilli.png]]

### *Keratin*
- Stratified squamous epithelium can contain keratin, but defined by how much
	- Lots - "keratinized"
	- Very little - "non-keratinized"
- Keratinized stratified squamous epithelium
	- A layer of keratin at the surface in the dead squamous cells, appear anuclear
	- waterproof
- Examples include the skin (epidermis)

**Summary - Epithelial Structure**
![[Epithelial Structure Summary Flow Chart.png]]


---

### *Polarisation*
- The tight junction complex distinguishes an apical and basolateral membrane of the cell
	- Effectively a "top" and a "bottom"
	- Each domain expresses distinct lipid and protein components
- This demarcation (separation) of the cell membrane is polarisation

![[Polarisation of Epithelial Cells.png]]

#### *Polarisation*
- Example: epithelium lining renal tubules
- Tight junctions form complexes between cells
- Gives rise to an apical surface
- And a basolateral surface

![[Polarisation of Epithelium Lining Renals Tubules.png]]

- This enables transport of ions, solutes and water
	- Transepithelial transport
- Often against their ionic (electrical) and concentration (chemical) gradient

#### *Transepithelial Transport*
- Transepithelial transport is either:
	- Paracellular
	- Transcellular
	- (Or both)

![[Transepithelial Transport.png]]

**Paracellular**
- transport occurs between the cells via tight junctions
- epithelia are considered "leaky" or "tight" depending on tight junctions
- established  electrochemical gradients "drag" molecules

**Transcellular**
- transport through cell
- crosses both apical and basolateral membranes
- requires transporters/channels
- usually energised by a pump e.g. Na$^+$/K$^+$ ATPase
- establishes an electrochemical gradient favourable for movement of ion/solute against its electrochemical gradient

**Examples**
