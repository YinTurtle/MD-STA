## 1. What is Radiology?

**Definition:**  
Radiology is the branch of medicine that uses _radiant energy_ (such as X-rays, radio waves, ultrasound, or radioactive materials) to **diagnose and treat disease**.

|Role|Description|
|---|---|
|**Radiologist**|Doctor who interprets imaging (X-ray, CT, MRI) and performs image-guided procedures (e.g. biopsies, angiography).|
|**Radiographer**|Professional who performs the imaging. Those trained in ultrasound are called **Sonographers**.|
|**Clinical Oncologist**|Uses radiation to treat cancer (e.g. megavoltage X-rays, radionuclides).|

## 2. Overview of Imaging Modalities

|Modality|Radiation?|Key Uses|Advantages|Disadvantages|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**X-ray**|✅ Yes|Bone, lungs|Fast, cheap, available|Poor soft tissue contrast|
|**CT (Computed Tomography)**|✅ Yes|Trauma, chest, abdomen|Cross-sectional, quick|High radiation dose|
|**MRI**|❌ No|Brain, spine, soft tissue|Excellent contrast, no radiation|Expensive, slow, noisy|
|**Ultrasound**|❌ No|Abdomen, obstetrics, vessels|Safe, portable, real-time|Operator-dependent, poor for bone/air|
|**Nuclear Medicine (PET/SPECT)**|✅ Yes|Cancer, thyroid, bone scans|Shows function, localises disease|High dose, poor anatomical detail|

## 3. X-rays – The Basics

**Discovery:** Wilhelm Roentgen, 1895  
**Principle:**  
X-rays are **high-energy electromagnetic waves** that pass through the body.  
Dense tissues absorb more X-rays → appear **white**; less dense tissues absorb fewer → appear **dark**.

### The 5 Basic Radiographic Densities

|Density|Example|Appearance|
|---|---|---|
|Air|Lungs|Black|
|Fat|Subcutaneous tissue|Dark grey|
|Soft tissue / Water|Heart, muscle|Light grey|
|Bone|Skeleton|Off-white|
|Metal / Contrast|Implants, contrast dye|Bright white|

**Mnemonic:** “Air → Fat → Soft tissue → Bone → Metal” = darkest → brightest.

## 4. Common X-ray Views

|View|Description|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|**PA (Posteroanterior)**|Beam passes back → front|Standard CXR; accurate heart size|
|**AP (Anteroposterior)**|Beam passes front → back|Portable; heart appears enlarged|
|**Lateral**|Beam passes from side|Used with AP/PA for 3D orientation|

**Rule of Two:**  
Always image joints in **two planes (AP & Lateral)** and include **joint above and below**.

## 5. Specialised X-ray Techniques

- **Mammography:** Low-dose X-ray for detailed breast imaging (screening or diagnostic).
    
- **Fluoroscopy:** Continuous “live” X-ray — used for barium studies, fracture fixation, catheter placement.
    
- **Angiography:** X-ray + contrast to view blood vessels (e.g. coronary angiogram).
    
- **Interventional Radiology (IR):**
    
    - Minimally invasive, image-guided procedures.
        
    - Examples: **angioplasty**, **stenting**, **biopsies**.
        
    - Think of IR as _“surgery through images.”_

## 6. Computed Tomography (CT)

**Principle:**  
CT takes many X-rays in a circle and uses computers to make detailed **cross-sectional slices** (like slicing a loaf of bread).

**Advantages**

- Fast and widely available.
    
- Excellent for **bone, lung, trauma, bleeding**.
    
- 3D reconstruction possible.
    

**Disadvantages**

- **High radiation dose** (≈ 100–300 chest X-rays).
    
- Poorer soft tissue contrast than MRI.
    
- Expensive.

## 7. Nuclear Medicine (Scintigraphy, SPECT, PET)

**Principle:**  
A **radiopharmaceutical** (radioactive tracer + biological molecule) is injected → emits **gamma rays** → detected by a **gamma camera** → computer builds the image.

|Technique|Principle|Example|
|---|---|---|
|**Scintigraphy**|Detects gamma rays from tracers like Technetium-99m|Bone scan for metastases|
|**SPECT**|3D reconstruction of scintigraphy|Cardiac perfusion imaging|
|**PET (Positron Emission Tomography)**|Uses positron-emitting isotopes, often combined with CT|Cancer staging (FDG-PET)|

**Pros:** Shows _function_ (metabolic activity).  
**Cons:** High radiation dose, limited anatomical detail.

---

## 8. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)

**Principle:**

- Uses a **powerful magnet** to align hydrogen atoms.
    
- **Radiofrequency pulses** disturb this alignment; returning signals are converted into images.
    
- **No ionising radiation.**
    

### MRI Sequences

|Sequence|Bright Structures|Tip|
|---|---|---|
|**T1-weighted**|Fat|“T1 → 1 bright thing (Fat)”|
|**T2-weighted**|Fat + Water|“T2 → 2 bright things (Fat + Water)”|

**Advantages**

- Best for **brain, spine, joints, soft tissue**.
    
- No radiation.
    
- Excellent differentiation between pathologies.
    

**Disadvantages**

- Expensive and time-consuming.
    
- Unsafe for metal implants or pacemakers.
    
- Noisy; may need sedation in children.

## 9. Ultrasound (US)

**Principle:**  
High-frequency **sound waves** reflect differently off tissues → returning echoes form an image.

**Advantages**

- No radiation – safe in **pregnancy**.
    
- Real-time imaging (movement, blood flow).
    
- Portable and cheap.
    

**Disadvantages**

- **Operator-dependent**.
    
- Poor for **bone or air-filled structures** (e.g. lungs, bowel).
    
- May be limited by obesity or overlying gas.
    

**Analogy:**  
Like SONAR – the probe sends out sound “pings,” and echoes map the internal landscape.

## 10. Radiation Safety & Guidelines

**Principle: ALARA – “As Low As Reasonably Achievable”**  
→ Always minimise radiation while achieving diagnostic goals.

**IRMER (UK Law):**  
Ionising Radiation (Medical Exposure) Regulations – ensure justification, optimisation, and limitation of radiation use.

**Before Requesting Imaging:**

1. Will the result **change management**?
    
2. Is there a **safer alternative** (e.g. ultrasound or MRI)?
    
3. Has the test **already been done** recently?
    
4. Is the patient **pregnant** or possibly pregnant?

## 11. Common Pitfalls in Imaging Requests

- Repeating unnecessary tests.
    
- Ordering the **wrong investigation** (e.g. bone scan instead of CT).
    
- Not including enough **clinical detail** (radiologists need context).
    
- Over-investigation → overdiagnosis, anxiety, and cost.

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

- **X-rays = structure**, **Nuclear = function**.
    
- **CT** gives fast 3D “slices”; **MRI** gives detailed, radiation-free anatomy.
    
- **Ultrasound** = safe and dynamic.
    
- Always weigh **diagnostic value vs radiation risk**.
    
- “Right test, right time, right question.”
