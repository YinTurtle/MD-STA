### *Cell Specialisations*

Tissues are aggregate of specialised cells designed for specific function.

**Single celled organisms**
(grouped into Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes)
- e.g. Unicellular amoebae

**Simple multicellular organisms**
- e.g. alga volvox

**Complex multicellular organisms**
- e.g. higher animals/plants

Advantages: division of labour and coordinated function for tissues, large organisms possible, support and motility - exploitation of resources not available to single cells.

#### *How to Make Differentiated (Specialised) Cells of Tissues*

- Each cell contains the genome present in the first cell of the embryo. Humans are thought to have approximately 25 – 30,000 genes that encodes all the proteins (and proteins determine cell function and structure).
- Most body cells express only a subset of these genes providing distinct characteristics of each cell type.
- Selective expression of proteins and gene silencing yields hundreds of different cell types in the human body (e.g., regulating transcription, modification of DNA, through DNA methylation).
- *Differentiation programmes* determine levels and pattern of protein expression – this then determines how the cell looks and how it functions. These programmes are mostly quite stable in the adult tissues.
- Differentiation produces cells with strikingly distinct appearance, but most cells contain a similar sets of organelles (nucleus, ER, Golgi, mitochondria, lysosomes, cytoskeletal elements etc.)

### *Differentiation and Proliferation in Descendants or Originator (Stem) Cells make Tissues*

- Originator cell is called a Stem Cell. Stem cells are found in the early embryo (pluripotent) and in tissue (tissue specific)
- Undergoes asymmetric division (stem cell line continues)
- New sets of genes/proteins expressed to produce cells with distinct functions.
- Gene expression is regulated by transcription factors.
- Gene expression is regulated by transcription factors. Transcription factors act in different combinations to determine differentiation patterns.

### *Haematopoietic (Blood-forming) Stem Cell*

Stem cells were first identified in hematopoietic system by Ernest McCulloch and James Till in 1961.
Several distinct blood types possess specialised functions:
- Erythrocyte – Transport of O2 and CO2.
- Granulocytes and macrophage – Phagocytic cells. o Platelets – coagulation.
- Lymphocyte – immune response. Immunoglobulin synthesised from Plasma cells – B-lymphocyte.
The above cells have limited life-span, ranging between a day and month, hence the role of stem cells. Good examples: red blood cells (120 days), epithelial cells lining the digestive tract, spermatozoa etc.

### *Multiple Copies of Cell Types*

Tissues contain multiple copies of cells grouped together that cooperate in a similar specialised function.
Despite the differences in tissues appearance, the structural organisation and the varying physiological functions of organs. The tissues that make up these organs are classified into four types.
Tissues are classified on two basic parameters i.e., morphology (epithelial and connective tissues) and function (muscles and nerves).

**Four basic types of body tissues:**
- Epithelial tissue
- Neural tissue
- Connective tissue
- Muscle

**Things to look out for in different tissue types:**
- cell shape
- prominent intracellular organelles
- binding and association of cells (junctions)
- arrangement and location of cells
- extracellular components

### *Epithelial Tissue*
[[Epithelia]]

Epithelium - avascular (no blood vessels but still need nourishment)
- covers body surfaces with sheet-like cells
- lines body cavities
- form the secretory portion of glands
- are interconnected by intercellular joints

They possess a basement membrane for mechanical support/strength and specialised cells for locomotion, absorption or secretion e.g., microvilli (phagocytosis, and absorption of nutrients); and cilia (movement, involved in transport of mucus along the respiratory track)

#### *Epithelial can Perform Specific or Different Functions*

**Secretion**
Columnar epithelium (small intestine, colon stomach lining and gastric gland).

**Absorption**
Columnar epithelium (intestines and proximal convoluted tubules in the kidney)

**Transportation**
Epithelial transport occurs across the cells via (pinocytosis/endocytosis) or along the surface (driven by motile cilia)
- Motile cilia are whip-like organelles that protrude from cells to generate directional fluid flow for movement or clearance

**Mechanical support**
Stratified squamous epithelium (skin)

**Receptor function**
Transduce external stimuli (taste buds - tongue, olfactory epithelium

**Distinct Morphology of Epithelium**
- Free surface or apical domain
	- usually modified
- Lateral domain
	- helps with cell to cell communication
- Basement membrane
	- basically the basement

Epithelial tissue are avascular; therefore, nutrients and oxygen are obtained from the capillaries of the connective tissue which the basement membrane of the epithelial tissue rest.

### *Movement in Cilia Driven by Microtubule Sliding*
There are three type of eukaryotic cilia:

**Primary cilia**
are found in most animal cells (epithelial, connective tissues, muscle, and nervous tissues) and function in sensory organs. Odorant receptors on olfactory neurons and photoreceptors on retinal cells are found on primary cilia.

**Motile cilia**
are responsible for cell movement (e.g., movement of fluid and particles across the epithelial). The axoneme possess microtubule associated protein to produced needed force for motility.

**Nodal cilia**
are found within the embryo during gastrulation. They possess distinct clockwise rotational movement.

### *Nervous Tissue*

#### *Nervous System*
Collects, processes/integrates and sends information (cells are adapted for local and distant cellular communication)
In terms of structure, nervous tissue consists of two cells: (a) nerve cells and (b) glial or supporting cells.

The body's sensory system collects information then sends information to the CNS, which processes and integrates, then sends a response to the motor nerves which controls the muscles or glands to do its function.

CNS - central nervous system (brain and spinal cord)
PNS - peripheral nervous system (body and head innervation)

For every 1 neurons, 10 glial support cells.

#### *Neurons*

Nerve cells (neurons) are separate cells that communicate by releasing chemical secretion at the end of cell processes. They possess the ability to communicate precisely and rapidly.
- A neuron has a cell body (soma), receptive dendrites, a transmitting axon and an end terminal called the synapse. This structural arrangement forms the unidirectional basis for neuronal signalling.
- Neurons are chemically and electrically excitable. Neuronal excitation (depolarisation) produces an action potential down the axon to the end terminal resulting in release of neurotransmitter.
