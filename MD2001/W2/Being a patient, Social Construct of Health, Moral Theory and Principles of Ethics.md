# **1.2 The Patient Journey (Slides 3, 18–22)**

Repeated 4 times across slides for emphasis:

- **Sensations → Symptoms → Seeking advice → Tests → Diagnosis → Treatment → Recovery → Rehabilitation**  
    (Shows illness as a _process_, not an event)
    

Slides 21–22 expand reactions:

- **Shock**
    
- **Disbelief**
    
- **Poor memory**
    
- **Searching for information**
    

Patients often **cannot recall** key parts of diagnostic conversations — important for communication pacing, repetition, checking understanding.

---

# **1.3 Emotional Reactions to Diagnosis (Slides 4–13)**

These slides provide _rich qualitative excerpts_ showing:

### **Common patterns across cancer diagnoses:**

- **Dissociation** (“out-of-body”, depersonalisation)
    
- **Switching off** after hearing “the key sentence”
    
- **Appearing calm while internally distressed**
    
- **Bottling up feelings**
    
- **Fear for children or family**
    
- **Feeling devastated due to lack of information**
    

Patients want:

- Clear explanation
    
- Avoidance of overly “grim” or ambiguous phrasing
    
- Emotional support
    
- Information immediately accessible
    

Clinical implication:  
👉 **Your communication style deeply modulates patient distress.**  
This links directly to **medical ethics (respect, beneficence)** and **social construction** (meaning patients assign to illness).

---

# **1.4 Reaction Differences (Prostate vs Breast vs Ovarian) (Slides 10–13)**

Patients vary:

- Some are **practical, stoic**, focusing only on controllable actions
    
- Others are **frightened**, catastrophising, overwhelmed
    
- Men often lack basic anatomical knowledge → panic (e.g., prostate location confusion)
    

Slide 13 shows the patient self-educating afterwards, wishing the doctor had explained earlier.

Clinical implication:  
👉 _Never assume baseline patient knowledge._

---

# **1.5 Treatment Experiences (Slide 14)**

Radiotherapy perceived as harder than chemotherapy because:

- Daily confrontation with illness (“the sign on the door”)
    
- Exposure to others who are visibly unwell
    
- Lack of counselling
    
- Repeated undressing → vulnerability
    

💡 This demonstrates the **psychosocial burden** of treatment, not just biological.

---

# **1.6 Living With Chronic Disease (Slide 15)**

Patients describe:

- Re-prioritising life
    
- Shifting values
    
- Acceptance and gratitude
    
- Fear mixed with meaning-making
    

Links to **social construction**: chronic illness reshapes identity.

---

# **1.7 Family Reactions (Slide 16)**

Example: brother unable to make eye contact for 14 months → **social stigma, embarrassment, avoidance**.

---

# **1.8 Medically Unexplained Symptoms (Slides 23–36)**

Common features:

- Very high GP & hospital utilisation (Slide 25 → quantitative study)
    
- High psychological load
    
- Symptoms often improve spontaneously (Kroenke slide: 75% improve in 2 weeks)
    
- GP responses often _normalise_ symptoms quickly → may miss emotional content
    

This intersects with **communication**, **social stigma**, and **ethical duty** (beneficence + autonomy).

---

# **1.9 Communication During Consultations (Slides 29–36)**

The long GP vignette:

- Patient reveals _progressively deeper psychological distress_:
    
    - “down… crying…”
        
    - “terrible feeling inside”
        
    - “nightmares… blackouts… falling…”
        

GP response pattern:

- Repeated reassurance (“doesn’t sound like your heart”)
    
- Biomedical focus first
    
- Delayed recognition of psychosocial content
    

Clinical lessons:

- Patients disclose symptoms **gradually**
    
- Affective cues (“down”, “crying”) signal need to explore mental health
    
- Reassurance too early can block deeper disclosure
    

---

# **1.10 Doctor Behaviour (Slide 37)**

- Listening
    
- Explaining
    
- Decision-making
    
- Professional guidelines
    
- Clinical skill
    
- Greeting preferences (Slides 38–43)
    

Patients prefer:

- Handshake (78%)
    
- First names (50%) or both names
    
- Doctors giving both names (59% do this)
    

Clinical implication:  
👉 _Start encounters with clear naming and warmth._

---

# 🌐 **2. SOCIAL CONSTRUCTION OF HEALTH — Detailed Notes**

---

# **2.1 Core Concept (Slides 3–6)**

- Health and illness are not purely biological: **meanings are constructed through language, culture, social interaction**.
    
- Reality is socially constructed → what counts as “illness” or “normal” changes over time.
    

Links to patient experience:  
➡️ How patients interpret diagnosis depends on their cultural scripts and personal history.

---

# **2.2 Why This Matters in Medicine (Slide 7)**

- Illness is experienced AND interpreted
    
- Doctors must understand cultural expectations to deliver patient-centred care
    

---

# **2.3 Examples (Slides 8–9)**

- **Beauty standards** (rapidly shifting)
    
- **Childbirth norms** (vaginal vs caesarean = medical + cultural)
    
- **Mental health stigma** varies by society
    

---

# **2.4 Goffman’s Stigma (Slides 10–12)**

- “Spoiled identity”: patient feels deviated from social norms
    
- People conceal stigmatised identities (HIV, STIs, depression, obesity)
    
- Front stage vs back stage behaviour
    

Links directly to:  
➡️ Being a Patient — the prostate cancer patient whose family member avoided him.

---

# **2.5 Three Themes of Social Construction in Health (Slides 12–13)**

### 1. **Cultural variations**

(e.g., diabetes, depression, death rituals, sexual health taboos)

### 2. **Illness experience as constructed**

- Type 2 diabetes → guilt, blame
    
- Endometriosis → contested, invalidation
    
- Cancer survivorship → “warrior narrative” pressure
    

### 3. **Medical knowledge as constructed**

- Homosexuality once a “disorder”
    
- Racialised medical myths (Black people “higher pain threshold”)
    
- Changing standards of professionalism
    

---

# **2.6 Medicalisation (Slides 28–32)**

Medicalisation = defining normal experiences as medical problems.

Examples:

- **Death** → moved from family rituals → hospitalised, professionalised
    
- **Menopause** → increasingly framed as pathology requiring HRT
    
- **Sadness, shyness, aging** → risk of pathologising normal variation
    

**Over-medicalisation impacts:**

- Unnecessary procedures
    
- Cost burden
    
- Loss of autonomy
    
- Stigma and labelling
    
- Pharmaceutical dependency
    

---

# **2.7 Foucault: The Clinical Gaze (Slide 33)**

- Medicine categorises, disciplines bodies
    
- Creates norms
    
- Doctors hold hierarchical power
    

Links to “Being a Patient”:  
➡️ Patients may feel judged, dismissed, or not believed.

---

# **2.8 Implications for Practice (Slides 34–36)**

- Cultural competence
    
- Non-stigmatising language
    
- Holistic care
    
- Awareness of social context
    

Case study: HIV-positive patient → struggles with stigma → avoids follow-up → threatens treatment adherence.

---

# ⚖️ **3. MORAL THEORY & PRINCIPLES OF ETHICS — Detailed Notes**

---

# **3.1 What is Ethics? (Slides 1–3)**

Ethics = study of how we ought to live.  
Medical ethics = applying this to clinical decisions.

---

# **3.2 Three Main Moral Theories (Slides 7–15)**

## **A. Deontology — Kant**

- Duty-based
    
- Follow rules regardless of consequences
    
- Example: not lying to protect Jeff
    
- Strength: clarity, consistency
    
- Weakness: rigid, ignores outcomes
    

## **B. Consequentialism — Bentham, Mill**

- Right action = best outcome
    
- Utilitarianism: maximise pleasure/minimise pain
    
- Vaccine example: population benefit > rare risks
    
- Weakness: can justify harming individuals
    

## **C. Virtue Ethics — Aristotle**

- Right action = what a virtuous person would do
    
- Focuses on character (caring, trustworthy, disciplined)
    
- Weakness: vague, culturally variable
    

---

# **3.3 Limitations (Slide 17)**

No single theory works always → ethics uses **all as lenses**.

---

# **3.4 Four Principles of Medical Ethics (Slides 18–33)**

## **1. Autonomy**

- Right to make decisions (even irrational ones)
    
- Competent adult can refuse any treatment, even life-saving
    
- JW example (refusal of transfusion)
    

## **2. Beneficence**

- Act to benefit the patient
    
- Conflicts with autonomy when patient choices differ
    

## **3. Non-maleficence**

- “Do no harm”
    
- Links to Doctrine of Double Effect
    

## **4. Justice**

- Fair distribution of healthcare resources
    
- Equivalent needs → equivalent access
    

---

# **3.5 Doctrine of Double Effect (Slides 24–31)**

Action with both good and bad effects is permissible ONLY if:

1. Action itself is good
    
2. Intention is good
    
3. Bad effect is not a means to the good effect
    
4. Good outweighs bad
    

Classic example:

- High-dose morphine for pain relief even though it may hasten death
    

---

# 🔗 **INTERLINKING: How These Three Topics Fit Together Naturally**

### **1. Patient Experience ↔ Social Construction**

- How patients **interpret** diagnoses (shock, fear, avoidance) is shaped by culture and stigma.
    
- E.g., prostate cancer → embarrassment among male relatives; HIV stigma → avoidance of care.
    

### **2. Patient Experience ↔ Ethics**

- Communication quality (Being a Patient slides) links to **respect for autonomy**, **beneficence**, and **non-maleficence**.
    
- Poorly delivered bad news can inflict harm → ethical failure.
    
- Ignoring psychosocial distress breaches beneficence.
    

### **3. Social Construction ↔ Ethics**

- Autonomy requires understanding the **patient’s cultural meaning** of illness.
    
- Justice demands awareness of **social inequities** (e.g., racialised pain myths).
    
- Over-medicalisation raises questions about **non-maleficence**.
    

### **4. All Three ↔ Better Clinical Practice**

Together they emphasise:

- Patient-centred care
    
- Cultural humility
    
- Thoughtful ethical reasoning
    
- Non-judgmental communication
    
- Awareness of stigma and social context

# 🔥 **HIGH-YIELD EXAM SECTION (Ultra-Condensed)**

### **The 4 Principles**

- **Autonomy** → patient chooses
    
- **Beneficence** → doctor acts for good
    
- **Non-maleficence** → avoid harm
    
- **Justice** → fair allocation
    

### **Three Moral Theories**

- **Deontology** = duty
    
- **Consequentialism** = outcomes
    
- **Virtue ethics** = good doctor → good action
    

### **Social Construction: 3 Themes**

1. Cultural variation
    
2. Illness experience
    
3. Medical knowledge
    

### **Stigma (Goffman)**

- Spoiled identity
    
- Concealment, shame
    
- Impacts adherence & disclosure
    

### **Medicalisation**

- Expanding “illness” boundaries
    
- Risks: over-diagnosis, dependency, loss of autonomy
    

### **Patient Journey Emotions**

- Shock
    
- Dissociation
    
- Poor memory
    
- Searching for information
    
- Need for clear communication
    

### **MUS Patterns**

- High utilisation
    
- Symptoms gradually disclosed
    
- Reassurance alone insufficient
