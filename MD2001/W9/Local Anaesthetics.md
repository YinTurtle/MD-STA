- Identify examples of local anaesthetics and explain their **clinical uses** (e.g., **lidocaine**, **bupivacaine**).
    
- Recognise how the **weak base structure** of local anaesthetics interacts with **pH**, influencing their **mechanism of action**.
    
- Explain **why different local anaesthetics** have varying times of action and how their duration can be modified (e.g., **vasoconstriction**).
    
- Identify the **different routes of administration** and their clinical applications.
    
- Predict potential **dangers and side effects** (e.g., **toxicity**, **cardiovascular effects**, **CNS effects**).
    

## **1. Overview of Local Anaesthetics**

### **Uses of Local Anaesthetics:**

- **When loss of consciousness is unnecessary or undesirable** (e.g., during minor surgery or procedures).
    
- **Post-operative analgesia**.
    
- Adjunct to **general anaesthesia** to reduce overall drug doses.
    
- For **major surgery** with **sedation**.

## **2. Types and Structure of Local Anaesthetics**

### **Amides (more common)**:

- **Lidocaine (Lignocaine):** Medium-acting, rapid onset.
    
- **Prilocaine:** Medium-acting, no vasodilation.
    
- **Bupivacaine / Levobupivacaine:** Long-acting, slow onset.
    
- **Articaine:** Short-acting, rapid onset.
    

### **Esters (rarely used)**:

- **Tetracaine:** Long-acting, slow onset.
    
- **Chloroprocaine:** Medium-acting.
    
- **Benzocaine:** Atypical mechanism of action. Less dependent on other mechanisms of actions.
    

**Key Point:**

- **Amides** are more stable and less likely to cause allergic reactions compared to **esters**.
    
- All structure names that ends with **caine** are typically anaesthetics

## **3. Mechanism of Action**

- Local anaesthetics **block voltage-gated sodium (Na⁺) channels**.
    
- **Na⁺ influx** is inhibited, **stabilising excitable membranes** → **prevents depolarisation**.
    
- The effect is **reversible** and **localised**.
    

**Question to Consider:**

- **Do we block just pain fibers?**
    
- **How exactly does the local anaesthetic block the Na⁺ channel?**

## **4. Structure of Peripheral Nerves**

- **Fiber Types and Sensitivity to Anaesthetics:**
    
    - Different **fiber diameter**, **myelination status**, and **function** affect the **blocking action**.
        
    - **Pain fibers** are blocked first, followed by **temperature**, **proprioception**, and **skeletal muscle tone**.
        

---

## **5. Factors Influencing Local Anaesthetic Action**

- **Fiber Diameter**: Smaller fibers are blocked more easily than larger ones.
    
- **Myelination**: Myelinated fibers are blocked more efficiently than unmyelinated ones.

- **Length of Nerve Exposed**: The longer the nerve is exposed to the drug, the more likely it is to be blocked.
    
- **Concentration of the Drug**: Higher concentrations lead to quicker block onset.

## **6. Voltage-Gated Sodium Channels and Action**

- Local anaesthetics are **weak bases**; they exist in **neutral** or **protonated** forms.
    
- **Protonated form** (ionised) **blocks the channel** by binding **intracellularly**.
    
- Ionised form cannot pass through the membrane, which is why **pH affects uptake**.
- The lower the pH, the more ionised
    

**pKa Concept:**

- The **pKa** is the pH at which 50% of the drug is ionised.
    
- **Most local anaesthetics** have pKa values between **8 and 9**.

## **7. Onset and Duration of Action**

- **Use-dependence**: Faster **firing** neurons are blocked more quickly.
    
- **Duration of action** is influenced by:
    
    - **Blood flow** to the area (higher blood flow = faster removal).
        
    - **Plasma esterases** (for ester-linked local anaesthetics).
        
    - **Hydrophobicity** of the drug (affects its binding).
        

---

## **8. Increasing Duration of Action**

- **Vasodilation** (most local anaesthetics) leads to faster removal.
    
    - **Cocaine** causes **vasoconstriction**, while **prilocaine** has minimal vasodilation.
        
- **Vasoconstriction (e.g., adrenaline)** can:
    
    - **Prolong the effect** (by reducing blood flow).
        
    - **Reduce bleeding** during surgery.
        

**Clinical Relevance:**

- **Epinephrine** used with local anaesthetics to prolong action in surgeries, but **caution** in distal areas (fingers, toes) due to risk of ischaemia.

## **9. Routes of Administration**

- **Surface**: Applied directly (e.g., mucous membranes of nose, mouth, eye).
    
- **Infiltration**: Injected into tissues near nerve branches or terminals.
    
- **Nerve Block**: Injections near large nerves or regions.
    
- **Intravenous Regional Anaesthesia (IVRA)**: Cuffed technique to contain the anaesthetic to one limb.
    
- **Extradural (Epidural)**: Typically used for thoracic, lumbar, sacral regions.
    
- **Subarachnoid (Intrathecal)**: Direct injection into the subarachnoid space (CSF).
    

**Clinical Focus:**

- **Epidural anaesthesia**: Used in labor, thoracic and abdominal surgery for **regional pain relief**.

## **10. Eutectic Mixture of Local Anaesthetics (EMLA)**

- Mixture of **lignocaine** and **prilocaine**.
    
- **Lower melting point** allows higher concentrations, improving skin absorption.
    
- Used for **dermal anaesthesia** (e.g., for needle insertion).
    

**Clinical Relevance:**

- Commonly used in pediatric patients or for minor dermal procedures.
    

---

## **11. Side Effects of Local Anaesthetics**

- **Cardiovascular Effects**: Dysrhythmias, sudden fall in blood pressure due to effects on heart and vasculature.
    
- **CNS Effects**: Restlessness, tremors, convulsions, respiratory depression, and in extreme cases, **death** due to high plasma concentrations.
    

**Clinical Focus:**

- **Toxicity** usually occurs if the anaesthetic **enters systemic circulation** (via **overdose**, poor technique, or fast absorption).
	- To stop this, first you stop administering anaesthetics
	- Then consider intravenous lipid emulsion therapy , since anaesthetics are hydrophobic, they would gather

## **12. Summary of Key Points**

- Local anaesthetics **block voltage-gated sodium channels**.
    
- The drug needs to **enter the cell** to exert its effect, with its action dependent on **pH** and **pKa**.
    
- The **onset of action** is related to the **rate of neuronal firing** and **drug concentration**.
    
- **Myelinated, smaller fibers** are blocked **first**, with the **pain fibers** being most sensitive.
    
- Routes of administration affect the **localisation** and **duration** of action.
    
- The **vasoconstriction effect** can **prolong the anaesthetic effect**.
