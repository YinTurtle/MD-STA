### **1. DNA Replication Overview**

**Key Principle:**  
Replication is **semi-conservative** — each daughter DNA molecule has:

- **One parental (old)** strand
    
- **One newly synthesized** strand
    

🧪 **Meselson & Stahl (1958)** proved this using isotopic labeling (^15N and ^14N DNA).  
→ After one generation: hybrid (half-heavy) DNA → confirmed **semi-conservative model**.

---

### **2. Directionality and Replication Fork**

- DNA strands are **antiparallel** (5′→3′ and 3′→5′).
    
- **DNA polymerase** can **only synthesize 5′→3′**, adding nucleotides to the 3′-OH of the growing chain.
    

#### ➤ **Leading strand**

- Synthesized **continuously** in the same direction as the fork opens.
    

#### ➤ **Lagging strand**

- Synthesized **discontinuously** as **Okazaki fragments**, each requiring an **RNA primer**.
    
- Fragments are later joined by **DNA ligase**.
    

🧠 **Focus on:**  
Replication fork asymmetry — both strands copied simultaneously but differently.

### **3. Key Enzymes in DNA Replication**

|Enzyme|Function|
|---|---|
|**Helicase**|Unwinds the double helix at the fork.|
|**Single-strand binding proteins (SSBPs)**|Prevent reannealing of separated strands.|
|**Primase**|Synthesizes RNA primers for DNA polymerase to start.|
|**DNA polymerase**|Extends the chain 5′→3′, proofreads 3′→5′.|
|**DNA ligase**|Joins Okazaki fragments (forms phosphodiester bond).|
|**Topoisomerase**|Relieves supercoiling tension ahead of the fork.|

🩺 **Clinical Note:**

- **Topoisomerase inhibitors** (e.g., ciprofloxacin, etoposide) are used as antibiotics and anticancer agents.
    

---

### **4. Speed and Efficiency**

- Entire **human genome (~3 × 10⁹ bp)** is replicated in **~8 hours**.
    
- Multiple **origins of replication** operate simultaneously to speed up the process.
    

💡 **Remember:** Prokaryotes have a **single origin**, eukaryotes have **many**.

---

### **5. End-Replication Problem**

When the **lagging strand** reaches the end of a linear chromosome:

- The **final RNA primer** cannot be replaced → results in **shortening of DNA ends** after each round.
    

#### ➤ Solution: **Telomerase**

- Enzyme that extends **telomeres** (repetitive TTAGGG sequences).
    
- Uses an **RNA template** to add DNA to the 3′ end.
    

🧬 **Focus Concept:**

- **Somatic cells:** limited telomerase → aging.
    
- **Stem/germ cells & cancer cells:** active telomerase → unlimited divisions.
    

💊 **Clinical Link:**

- **Werner’s syndrome** = premature aging disorder due to **defective helicase** (impaired DNA repair & replication).
    

---

### **6. Replication Fidelity & Mutation Repair**

#### **Error Frequency**

- DNA polymerase error rate = ~1 mistake per 10⁴ nucleotides.
    
- With proofreading & repair, final mutation rate ≈ **1 error per 3 genomes replicated**.
    

#### **Error Correction**

1. **Proofreading (during synthesis):**
    
    - DNA polymerase detects mismatches → removes incorrect base via **3′→5′ exonuclease** activity.
        
2. **Post-replication mismatch repair:**
    
    - Detects distortions in helix caused by mismatches.
        
    - Removes and replaces the incorrect region.
        

💡 **Clinical Connection:**

- **Defects in mismatch repair (MMR)** → ↑ cancer risk (e.g., **Lynch syndrome / HNPCC**).
    

🧠 **Focus for exams:**  
Know the **difference between proofreading vs mismatch repair** and their timing (during vs after synthesis).

### **7. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)**

**Purpose:** Amplify a specific DNA region _in vitro_ from minimal starting material.

#### **Basic Steps:**

1. **Denaturation:** 95°C – DNA strands separate.
    
2. **Annealing:** 50–65°C – primers bind to target sequence.
    
3. **Extension:** 72°C – Taq polymerase synthesizes new strand.
    

🧪 **Cycle repeats** → exponential amplification.

#### **Clinical Uses:**

- Detect **infectious agents** (e.g., HIV, SARS-CoV-2).
    
- Identify **genetic mutations** and **carrier status**.
    
- **Forensic analysis** and **paternity testing**.
    
- **Copy number variation** analysis (e.g., gene amplifications in cancer).
    

💡 **Focus:** Understand _temperature steps, enzyme used (Taq polymerase)_, and **clinical diagnostic examples**.

---

### **8. DNA Sequencing (Sanger Chain-Termination Method)**

**Principle:**  
Incorporation of **dideoxynucleotides (ddNTPs)** causes **chain termination** → DNA fragments of varying lengths.

#### **Steps:**

1. DNA template + primer + DNA polymerase.
    
2. Add all 4 normal dNTPs + small amount of fluorescent ddNTPs.
    
3. Each terminated fragment ends with a ddNTP → detected by **capillary electrophoresis**.
    

💡 **Result:** Sequence read by color peaks (A, T, G, C).

#### **Clinical Uses:**

- **Mutation detection** (e.g., in GFAP gene causing **Alexander disease**).
    
- **Genetic diagnostics** and **personalized medicine**.
