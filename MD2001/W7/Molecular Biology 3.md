## **1. DNA vs RNA**

|Feature|DNA|RNA|
|---|---|---|
|Sugar|Deoxyribose (no –OH at 2′)|Ribose (has –OH at 2′)|
|Bases|A, T, G, C|A, U, G, C (uracil replaces thymine)|
|Structure|Double helix|Usually single-stranded, folds into complex shapes|
|Function|Long-term information storage|Multiple roles – messenger, catalytic, structural, regulatory|

🧠 **Exam Tip:**  
Remember that RNA is **chemically less stable** because of its 2′-OH, which can participate in hydrolysis.

## **2. Types and Functions of RNA**

|Category|Examples|Function|
|---|---|---|
|**Coding RNA**|**mRNA**|Carries genetic information from DNA to ribosome|
|**Structural RNA**|**rRNA**, **tRNA**, **snRNA**, **snoRNA**, **Cajal RNA**, **telomerase RNA**, **Xist RNA**|Form structural/catalytic parts of ribosomes, spliceosomes, etc.|
|**Regulatory RNA**|**miRNA, siRNA**|Regulate gene expression (post-transcriptional silencing)|
|**Guide RNA**|**snoRNA, gRNA**|Direct chemical modification or editing of RNAs|

💡 **Analogy:**  
If DNA is the “library,” mRNA is a “photocopy” of one page, and tRNA/rRNA are the “machinery” that reads and translates it.

---

## **3. Transcription Overview**

- **DNA template strand** is used to make **complementary RNA**.
    
- **RNA polymerase** synthesizes RNA **5′→3′**, reading the template **3′→5′**.
    
- No primer needed (unlike DNA polymerase).
    
- Less accurate than DNA replication, but errors are less harmful since RNA is short-lived.
    
- **Many RNA copies** can be made from one gene at once.
    

🧠 **Key Concept:**  
Transcription is selective — not all genes are transcribed at once; regulation controls which genes are active.

---

## **4. RNA Polymerases (Eukaryotes)**

|RNA Polymerase|Product|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|**Pol I**|rRNA (except 5S)|Nucleolus|
|**Pol II**|mRNA, snRNA, some miRNA|Protein-coding genes|
|**Pol III**|tRNA, 5S rRNA|Cytoplasmic/nuclear RNAs|

💡 **Clinical Note:**  
α-Amanitin (from poisonous mushrooms) inhibits **RNA Pol II** → ↓ mRNA → liver failure.

---

## **5. Promoters and Transcription Initiation**

### **Promoter**

- Region **upstream of transcription start site** where RNA polymerase binds.
    
- **Core promoter** (e.g., TATA box ~25 bp upstream): binds **TBP (TATA-binding protein)** → bends DNA.
    
- **Proximal promoter** (CAAT, GC boxes): binds general transcription factors (TFIIB, TFIID, TFIIF, etc.).
    
- **Housekeeping genes** often have **GC boxes** instead of TATA boxes.
    

🧠 **Focus:**  
Promoters determine **where transcription starts** and **how strongly** a gene is expressed.

---

## **6. Enhancers**

- **Short DNA sequences** that increase transcription efficiency.
    
- Can be **upstream or downstream**, **close or far**, and **orientation-independent**.
    
- Bind **transcription factors** → help assemble transcription machinery.
    
- Work through **DNA looping** or **scanning** mechanisms.
    
- **Silencers** have the opposite effect (repress transcription).
    

💡 **Analogy:**  
Promoters are the “door” where transcription begins; enhancers are the “loudspeakers” that make it happen faster.

---

## **7. Transcription Factors**

- Contain **two functional domains**:
    
    1. **DNA-binding domain** – recognizes specific sequences (TATA, GC box, etc.).
        
    2. **Activation domain** – interacts with transcription machinery or coactivators.
        

🧠 **Signal Response:**  
Many transcription factors are **signal-dependent**, e.g., steroid hormone receptors, which bind enhancers only when the hormone is present.

---

## **8. RNA Processing (Post-Transcriptional Modifications)**

After transcription, **pre-mRNA (hnRNA)** must be modified before it becomes **mature mRNA**.

### **a. 5′ Capping**

- Addition of **7-methylguanosine (m⁷G)** to 5′ end.
    
- Protects mRNA from degradation and helps ribosome recognition.
    

### **b. Splicing**

- **Introns** (non-coding regions) are removed, and **exons** (coding sequences) joined.
    
- Mediated by **spliceosome** (contains snRNPs = snRNA + protein).
    
- Occurs via **two transesterification reactions** forming a **lariat** intermediate.
    
- **Splice sites** recognized by conserved GU (5′) and AG (3′) sequences.
    

💡 **Focus:**  
Introns do not encode protein but allow regulation and diversity via alternative splicing.

### **c. 3′ Polyadenylation**

- Addition of **poly(A) tail (~100–250 adenines)**.
    
- Enhances stability, nuclear export, and translation efficiency.
    

---

## **9. Alternative Splicing**

- **Same gene → multiple mRNAs → multiple proteins**.
    
- Exon order maintained, but inclusion/exclusion varies.
    
- Generates **protein isoforms** with distinct functions.
    

🧬 **Clinical Example:**

- **Frasier syndrome:** defective alternative splicing in WT1 gene → abnormal kidney development (glomerulonephropathy).
    

🧠 **Exam Tip:**  
Alternative splicing helps explain the **“gene number paradox”** — humans make ~100,000 proteins from ~20,000 genes.

---

## **10. Gene Number Paradox**

**Answer:** C — _Making many different proteins from a limited number of genes._

🔹 Mechanisms increasing protein diversity:

- Alternative **promoters**
    
- Alternative **splicing**
    
- Alternative **3′ ends**
    
- **RNA editing**
    
- **Post-translational modifications**
