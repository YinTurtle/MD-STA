### **1. Identifying the Cause of Disease**

|Approach|What It Tells Us|Example|
|---|---|---|
|**Laboratory studies**|Examine cells, tissues, or DNA to identify biochemical or genetic abnormalities|BRCA1 gene in breast cancer|
|**Family studies**|Look at whether a disease runs in families|Type 1 diabetes, cystic fibrosis|
|**Epidemiology**|Studies patterns in populations (who gets what, where, and when)|Smoking → lung cancer|

**Analogy:**  
Think of disease causation like detective work — lab studies are fingerprints, family studies are motive, epidemiology is the crime map.

### **2. Heritability**

**Definition:**  
Heritability measures how much of the variation in a trait (like height or blood pressure) is due to genetic factors, _not environment._

> It’s a **population statistic**, not an individual one.

**Equation:**
![[Pasted image 20251014002614.png]]


Where:

- Phenotype = genes + environment + (genes x environment)
    ![[Pasted image 20251014002701.png|300]]

### **3. “Runs in Families” ≠ Always Genetic**

Traits seen in families could be due to:

- **Genetics** (e.g. eye colour)
    
- **Shared environment/social learning** (e.g. accent, habits)
    
- **Reinforcement** (e.g. behaviours rewarded in family)
    
- **Chance**
    

**Example:**  
Leadership “runs” in political families — not because of genes, but opportunity, exposure, and training.

---

### **4. Heritable ≠ Unchangeable**

Even strongly genetic traits can change with environment or treatment.

|Trait|Heritability|Can It Be Modified?|
|---|---|---|
|Height|High|Improved nutrition ↑ height|
|Vision defects|High|Corrected with glasses|
|PKU (Phenylketonuria)|Genetic enzyme defect|Controlled by low-phenylalanine diet|

**Key takeaway:**  
Genes load the gun, environment pulls the trigger.

---

### **5. Heritable ≠ Drug-Treatable**

Just because something has a genetic component doesn’t mean drugs are the solution.

- **Anxiety, bedwetting, nail biting** → respond to behavioural therapy.
    
- **Diet and lifestyle** → modify genetically influenced risks like obesity.

### **6. Measuring Heritability**

|Study Type|Method|Limitation|
|---|---|---|
|**Family studies**|Compare disease rates in relatives vs general population|Can’t separate genes from shared environment|
|**Twin studies**|Compare monozygotic (MZ) vs dizygotic (DZ) twins|MZ twins share more similar environments|
|**Adoption studies**|Compare adopted children to biological and adoptive parents|Hard to find large enough samples|
|**Migrant studies**|Compare disease rates before and after migration|Differences may be due to culture, diet, etc.|

**Diagram: Twin Study Design**

`MZ twins: 100% genes, shared environment DZ twins: 50% genes, shared environment`

If MZ concordance > DZ concordance → suggests genetic influence.

### **7. Infectious Agents**

|Type|Example|Key Feature|
|---|---|---|
|**Bacteria**|Streptococcus, E. coli|Treatable with antibiotics|
|**Viruses**|Influenza, HIV|Need host to replicate|
|**Fungi/Yeasts**|Candida|Opportunistic infections|
|**Protozoa/Parasites**|Malaria|Vector-borne|
|**Prions**|CJD|Misfolded proteins|

**Tropism:**  
Each pathogen has a preferred tissue — e.g. Hepatitis → liver, Rabies → brain.

---

### **8. Modes of Transmission**

- **Droplet:** Influenza
    
- **Faeco-oral:** Cholera
    
- **Venereal:** Syphilis
    
- **Blood:** HIV, Hepatitis B
    
- **Vector/Fomite:** Mosquito (Malaria), doorknobs (cold virus)
    
- **Horizontal:** person-to-person
    
- **Vertical:** mother to child
    
- **Zoonoses:** animal to human
    
- **Nosocomial:** hospital-acquired

### **9. Injury by Chemical Agents**

#### 🔹 Smoking

**Mechanisms:**

- **Mutagenic:** causes DNA mutations → cancer
    
- **Inflammatory:** → COPD
    
- **Nicotinic stimulation:** ↑ HR and BP
    
- **Endothelial injury:** → atherosclerosis
    
- **Carbon monoxide:** ↓ O₂ → fetal growth restriction
    

#### 🔹 Alcohol

|Mechanism|Effect|
|---|---|
|**Acetaldehyde**|Carcinogenic|
|**↑ Oestrogen**|Breast cancer risk|
|**↓ NAD**|Fatty liver (alters lipid metabolism)|
|**Reactive oxygen**|Membrane damage|
|**↓ Vitamin B**|Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome|
|**CNS depression**|Sedation, poor coordination|
|**Teratogenic**|Fetal alcohol syndrome|

---

### **10. Dust and Occupational Hazards**

|Dust Type|Disease|
|---|---|
|Hay dust|Hay fever, asthma|
|Asbestos|Mesothelioma|
|Coal dust|Coal workers’ pneumoconiosis|

**Coal Workers’ Pneumoconiosis (CWP):**  
Coal dust accumulates → inflammation → fibrosis → reduced lung capacity.

---

### **11. Drugs and Food**

- **Drugs:** Adverse effects from both prescribed and recreational drugs.
    
- **Food:** Environmental influence shown by colon cancer rates:
    
    - Stable in UK
        
    - Rising sharply in Japan (Westernisation of diet)
        

---

### **12. Injury from Physical Agents**

|Type|Examples|
|---|---|
|**Mechanical**|Trauma, accidents|
|**Thermal**|Burns, hypothermia|
|**Radiation**|Ionising (X-rays) → DNA damage; Non-ionising (UV) → skin cancer|

---

### **13. Gene–Environment Interactions**

**Definition:**  
How genes and environment combine to influence disease risk.

**Example: Sickle Cell and Malaria**

|Genotype|Blood Condition|Malaria Risk|Outcome|
|---|---|---|---|
|Hb-A/Hb-A|Normal|High|Death from malaria|
|Hb-S/Hb-S|Sickle cell disease|Low|Death from anemia|
|Hb-A/Hb-S|Carrier|Reduced|Survival advantage|

**Illustration:**

`Malaria endemic areas → more sickle cell carriers survive → pass on gene.`

This maintains the Hb-S gene in the population (balancing selection).

---

### **14. Changing Views of Genes and Environment**

Modern understanding:

- Most diseases are **multifactorial**.
    
- Genes provide a framework; environment sculpts the outcome.
    
- Health = continuous interplay between biology and surroundings.
