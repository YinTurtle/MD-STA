## 2️⃣ The Heart — Structure & Position

### Key Facts:

- Roughly the size of your fist (~250–350 g).
    
- Lies **obliquely** in the **middle mediastinum**, behind the sternum.
    
- About **2/3 of its mass** lies **left of the midsternal line**.
    
- Flanked and partly hidden by lungs.
    
- Surrounded by the **pericardium** (protective sac).
    

### 🔹 Clinical Relevance:

When placing a stethoscope or inserting a needle (e.g. pericardiocentesis), knowing this 3D orientation prevents injury to lungs or coronary vessels.

---

## 3️⃣ The Pericardium

### Layers:

1. **Fibrous pericardium** — tough outer layer
    
    - Anchors heart to diaphragm & great vessels
        
    - Prevents overfilling
        
    - Protects the heart from sudden changes in volume
        
2. **Serous pericardium** — thin, double layer
    
    - **Parietal** (lines inner fibrous layer)
        
    - **Visceral (epicardium)** (adheres to heart surface)
        
    - Between them = **pericardial cavity** → lubricating fluid for friction-free movement.
        

### 🩺 Clinical link:

Inflammation → _pericarditis_ → sharp chest pain, worse on inspiration or lying flat.  
Fluid buildup → _pericardial effusion_ → can cause _cardiac tamponade_ (heart compression).

## 4️⃣ Functional Overview — The Cardiovascular System

Think of it like a **central heating system**:

|Component|Analogy|Function|
|---|---|---|
|Heart|Pump|Generates pressure & flow|
|Arteries|Conducting pipes|Carry blood away from heart|
|Arterioles|Thermostatic controls|Adjust flow regionally|
|Capillaries|Radiators|Site of gas, nutrient & waste exchange|
|Veins|Return pipes|Return blood, store volume|
|Blood|Fluid medium|Carries O₂, CO₂, hormones, nutrients|

## 5️⃣ The Heart as a Pump

- **Four chambers:**
    
    - Right atrium → Right ventricle → _pulmonary circulation_
        
    - Left atrium → Left ventricle → _systemic circulation_
        
- **Valves** ensure **unidirectional flow**
    
- **Systole** = contraction phase
    
- **Diastole** = relaxation/filling phase
    
- **Total blood volume ≈ 5 L**
    

---

## 6️⃣ Circulatory Circuits

|Circuit|Side of heart|Function|Pressure|
|---|---|---|---|
|Pulmonary|Right|Sends deoxygenated blood to lungs|Low (~25 mmHg)|
|Systemic|Left|Sends oxygenated blood to body|High (~120 mmHg)|

**Exam tip:** “Right → lungs, Left → body.”  
Both circuits run **in series** — output of one equals input of the other.

---

## 7️⃣ Internal Features of the Heart

### **Right Atrium**

- Receives **deoxygenated** blood from:
    
    - Superior vena cava (head & upper body)
        
    - Inferior vena cava (lower body)
        
    - Coronary sinus (heart muscle)
        
- Contains **fossa ovalis** — remnant of _foramen ovale_ (foetal shunt bypassing lungs).
    
    - Closes at birth due to pressure changes.
        
    - If patent (PFO), can allow paradoxical emboli (stroke risk).
        

### **Right Ventricle**

- Sends blood to lungs via **pulmonary trunk** through **pulmonary valve** (semi-lunar).
    
- Inner surface has **trabeculae carneae** (muscle ridges) and **papillary muscles** attached to **chordae tendineae** (prevent valve prolapse).
    

### **Left Atrium**

- Receives **oxygenated** blood from **4 pulmonary veins** (left/right × superior/inferior).
    

### **Left Ventricle**

- Thickest wall (most muscular) → pumps blood at high pressure into **aorta**.
    
- **Mitral (bicuspid) valve** between LA & LV.
    
- **Aortic valve** at exit.
    

---

## 8️⃣ Heart Valves

|Valve|Location|Function|
|---|---|---|
|Tricuspid|RA → RV|Prevent backflow during RV contraction|
|Pulmonary|RV → Pulmonary trunk|Prevents reflux during diastole|
|Mitral|LA → LV|Prevent backflow during LV contraction|
|Aortic|LV → Aorta|Prevents reflux during diastole|

Semi-lunar valves (aortic, pulmonary) have **“watch-pocket” cusps** — catch blood to seal tightly when ventricles relax.

---

## 9️⃣ Coronary Circulation

- The heart receives its own blood supply via **right and left coronary arteries**, arising just above aortic valve cusps.
    
- Although heart = 0.5% body weight, it receives **~5% of cardiac output**.
    
- Blood drains mostly via **coronary sinus → right atrium**.
    
- A few **anterior cardiac veins** drain directly into RA.
    

### 🩺 Clinical relevance:

- Coronary artery blockage → myocardial infarction.
    
- Collateral circulation is limited — _time is muscle._
    

---

## 🔟 Cardiac Conduction System

**Purpose:** Coordinate contraction so atria & ventricles beat in sequence.

|Structure|Function|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|**SA node** (right atrium wall)|Pacemaker — initiates impulse|Rate controlled by autonomic nerves|
|**AV node**|Delays impulse|Allows ventricles to fill|
|**Bundle of His → bundle branches → Purkinje fibres**|Rapidly spread impulse to ventricles|Ensures simultaneous contraction|

➡ SA → atria → AV → ventricles.  
This sequence produces the **P-QRS-T** pattern on an **ECG**.

---

## 11️⃣ Integration With Other Systems

|System|Interaction|
|---|---|
|**Lungs**|Oxygenation of blood|
|**Kidneys**|Long-term regulation of blood volume & pressure|
|**Endocrine**|Hormones like adrenaline, ADH affect HR & BP|
|**Immune**|Circulating leukocytes & inflammatory response|
|**Thermoregulatory**|Skin vessels dilate/constrict to control temperature|

## 🧠 Quick Quiz (for self-check)

1. What are the two layers of the pericardium and their functions?
    Fibrous pericardium - thick walls to prevent overfilling and support the major structure and vessels of the heart.
    Serous pericardium - contains 2 layers, parietal and visceral, contains the pericardial cavity, which lubricates the layer for friction-free movement.
2. Why is the left ventricular wall thicker than the right?
    Because the left ventricle has to generate 4-5 times more pressure to push blood through the systemic arteries.
3. What is the function of the chordae tendineae?
    To anchor the valve leaflets (via papillary muscles) and prevent them from inverting or prolapsing into the atria during systole
4. What closes the foramen ovale at birth?
    Increased left atrial pressure (after first breath) causes the septum primum to press against the septum secundum, closing the foramen ovale.
5. Name the pacemaker of the heart.
    SA node
6. Which coronary artery supplies the majority of the left ventricle?
    The **left coronary artery (LCA)** — particularly its **anterior interventricular (LAD)** and **circumflex branches** — supply most of the **left ventricle**.
7. Explain the difference between pulmonary and systemic pressure.
	Pulmonary circulation is **low-pressure** (~25/10 mmHg) because it only pumps blood to the nearby lungs.  
	Systemic circulation is **high-pressure** (~120/80 mmHg) to deliver blood throughout the entire body.  
	Despite the difference in pressure, both sides pump **the same volume** of blood per beat (cardiac output).
