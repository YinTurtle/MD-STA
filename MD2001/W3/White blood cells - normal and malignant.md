## The Basics: What You Need to Know About WBCs

### The Five Types of White Blood Cells (and what they do)

Think of your immune system as a security team for a building. Each type of WBC has a different job:

#### 1. **Neutrophils (50-70% of WBCs)**

- **The First Responders** - like security guards who rush to any alarm
- Most common WBC in your blood
- Very short-lived: only 8-10 hours
- Part of **innate immunity** (non-specific defense)
- **What they do:** Eat bacteria using enzymes in their granules (lysozyme, peroxidase)
- **When they rise:** Bacterial infections, inflammation, malignancy
- **Key concept: CHEMOTAXIS** - they follow chemical signals to migrate toward bacteria (like following breadcrumbs to find the problem)

#### 2. **Lymphocytes (20-40% of WBCs)**

- **The Specialists** - like detectives who remember specific criminals
- Long lifespan (can last years!)
- Two main types:
    - **T cells** (mature in Thymus)
    - **B cells** (mature in Bone marrow)
- Part of **adaptive immunity** (specific, targeted response)
- **When they rise:** Viral infections, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia

#### 3. **Monocytes (5-10% of WBCs)**

- **The Clean-Up Crew & Intelligence Officers**
- In blood: called monocytes (circulate 8-12 hours)
- In tissues: become **macrophages** (live much longer)
- **What they do:**
    - Phagocytosis (eat stuff)
    - Act as **Antigen Presenting Cells (APCs)** - show T cells what they found
- Kill mycobacteria, fungi, intracellular organisms (like Listeria)

#### 4. **Eosinophils (1-6% of WBCs)**

- **The Parasite Fighters & Allergy Cells**
- Stain orange/pink with eosin dye
- Short lifespan in blood (4-5 hours), longer in tissues
- Granules contain Major Basic Protein and reactive oxygen species
- **When they rise (eosinophilia 2-6 × 10⁹/L):**
    - **Atopy**: asthma, eczema, hay fever (remember "A-E-A" - Atopy, Eosinophils, Allergy)
    - Parasitic worm infections
    - Some cancers (Hodgkin's disease, CML)
    - Drug reactions

#### 5. **Basophils (<1% of WBCs)**

- **The Allergy Trigger Cells**
- In blood: basophils
- In tissues: **mast cells**
- Dark granules contain: **histamine, leukotrienes, heparin, proteases**
- Have **IgE receptors** on surface
- **Key role:** Type 1 hypersensitivity (allergic) reactions/anaphylaxis

## Important Clinical Concept: The Differential Count

The **"differential"** tells you the _proportions_ of each WBC type - not just the total count!

**Why it matters clinically:**

- **High neutrophils** → Think bacterial infection
- **High lymphocytes** → Think viral infection
- **High eosinophils** → Think allergy, asthma, parasites
- Evidence of infection response/treatment effectiveness
- Can detect leukaemia early
- Shows bone marrow suppression from chemotherapy

## Allergic Reactions Explained Simply

### Type 1 Hypersensitivity (Anaphylaxis) - The Immediate Reaction

**The Setup (First Exposure):**

1. You're exposed to an allergen (peanut, bee venom, etc.)
2. Your body makes IgE antibodies against it
3. These IgE antibodies stick to basophils/mast cells and wait

**The Reaction (Second Exposure):**

1. Allergen comes back and binds to the IgE on the cell surface
2. This triggers **DEGRANULATION** - the cell dumps all its granules
3. Out comes: **histamine** (causes itching, swelling, vasodilation), **leukotrienes** (bronchoconstriction)
4. **Result:** Anaphylaxis - rash, swelling, breathing difficulty, low blood pressure

**Analogy:** Think of the mast cell as a water balloon filled with chemicals. The IgE is like a hair-trigger. When the allergen touches it, the balloon bursts and dumps everything at once.

## Chemotaxis - A Key Concept

**Definition:** The migration of cells in response to chemical signals

**How it works:**

- Bacteria release antigens from their cell walls
- These act like a "chemical trail"
- Neutrophils follow this trail to the infection site
- **Chemokines** (a subset of cytokines) specifically cause this cell migration

**Think of it like:** Sharks smelling blood in water and swimming toward it. The neutrophils "smell" the bacterial signals and move toward them.

## Clinical Testing: The Full Blood Count (FBC)

**What it measures:**

- Total WBC count
- Differential count (% of each type)
- Red cells, haemoglobin, platelets
- Detects abnormal cells

**How it's done:**

- Automated particle counters
- Blood films for abnormalities (stained slides viewed under microscope)
- Flow cytometry (uses fluorescent antibodies to identify cell types)
- Genetic tests if needed (cytogenetics, FISH)

**About 1,000 FBCs done per day just in Fife!**

## Leukaemia: Two Very Different Diseases

### Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia (CML) - The Success Story

**Key Features:**

- Slower progression
- **95%+ have the SAME genetic change:** Philadelphia chromosome
    - Translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22
    - Creates abnormal tyrosine kinase gene (BCR-ABL)
    - This enzyme is always "switched on" → uncontrolled cell growth

**Treatment - A Triumph of Molecular Medicine:**

- **Imatinib** (and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors)
- Works like a competitive inhibitor - blocks the ATP-binding site
- Well tolerated, highly effective
- Drug resistance is unusual
- Can monitor response with PCR blood tests
- **Survival has dramatically improved!**

**Why this matters:** CML is the poster child for "designer drugs" - we found the exact molecular problem and designed a drug to fix it!

### Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML) - The Challenge

**Key Features:**

- Rapid progression
- Presents with **bone marrow failure:**
    - Anaemia (not making red cells)
    - Bleeding/bruising (not making platelets)
    - Infections (not making normal WBCs)
- More common with increasing age

**The Problem:**

- **Diverse cytogenetic changes** - no single target
- Different patients have different genetic abnormalities
- Prognosis depends on specific cytogenetic type

**Treatment:**

- Intensive chemotherapy (causes complete marrow aplasia)
- Marrow regenerates from residual stem cells
- Stem cell transplant for selected patients
- **Complications during treatment:**
    - Infections (neutropenia, damaged mucosa, IV lines)
    - Bleeding (thrombocytopenia)
    - Psychological impact (long hospitalizations)
    - Need for repeated marrow tests

**Age Matters:**

- Younger patients (<60): steady improvement in survival
- Older patients: worse cytogenetics, can't tolerate treatment as well, fewer transplant options

## Key Takeaways for Exams

1. **Know the 5 WBC types and their basic functions**
2. **Chemotaxis = cell migration toward chemical signals**
3. **Differential count is clinically valuable** - tells you what type of process is happening
4. **Allergic reaction mechanism:** IgE → basophil/mast cell → degranulation → histamine release
5. **CML vs AML are completely different:**
    - CML: chronic, single genetic target, treatable with TKIs, good prognosis
    - AML: acute, diverse genetics, needs chemotherapy, variable prognosis
6. **Eosinophilia = think atopy or parasites**
7. **Innate immunity** (neutrophils, monocytes) vs **Adaptive immunity** (lymphocytes)

**Pro tip:** When you see a high WBC count, always look at the differential! The total number alone doesn't tell you what's going on - you need to know _which_ cells are elevated.
