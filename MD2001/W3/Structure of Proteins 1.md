## 📖 **1. Introduction – Why Proteins Matter**

Proteins are the **most functionally diverse biomolecules** in the body.  
Everything that happens inside a cell — movement, transport, regulation, catalysis — ultimately depends on proteins.

Think of them as the **tools and machines** that run your cells:

- Collagen acts as _the scaffolding_
    
- Haemoglobin as _the delivery truck_
    
- Enzymes as _the factory workers_
    
- Antibodies as _the security system_
    
- Regulatory proteins as _the managers_

## ⚙️ **2. Functions of Proteins – Overview**

|Function|Example|Explanation|Clinical Note|
|---|---|---|---|
|**1. Structural**|**Collagen**|Triple-helix structure provides tensile strength to tissues (skin, tendon, bone).|Defects cause _Ehlers–Danlos_ or _Osteogenesis imperfecta_.|
|**2. Transport**|**Haemoglobin**|4 subunits, each with a haem group carrying 1 O₂ molecule. Conformational change controls oxygen binding/release.|Mutation → _Sickle Cell Disease_.|
||**LDL & LDL receptor**|LDL transports cholesterol; receptor mediates uptake via endocytosis.|LDL-R mutation → _Familial Hypercholesterolaemia_.|
|**3. Defence**|**Antibodies (Immunoglobulins)**|Y-shaped; bind antigens with high specificity.|Foundation of vaccines, immune memory.|
|**4. Enzymatic (Catalysis)**|**Lysozyme**|Cleaves bacterial polysaccharide bonds → bactericidal.|Deficiency → vulnerability to infection.|
|**5. Regulation**|**Lac Repressor**|Controls gene expression in response to lactose presence.|Demonstrates protein-DNA regulation principle.|

### 🧩 **Key Principle**

> **“Structure determines function.”**  
> Specific _binding_ depends on _shape (conformation)_.  
> Change the shape → change the function.

## 🔬 **3. What Are Proteins?**

- Proteins are **linear polymers** of **amino acids** joined by **peptide bonds**.
    
- Despite being complex, they follow an underlying **hierarchical structure**.
    

---

### 🧱 **Hierarchy of Protein Structure**

|Level|Description|Example|Stabilising Forces|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Primary**|Linear sequence of amino acids|Ala–Gly–Pro–Val|Peptide bonds|
|**Secondary**|Local folding pattern (α-helix, β-sheet, turns)|α-helix in keratin|Hydrogen bonds|
|**Tertiary**|Overall 3D folding of one chain|Myoglobin|Hydrophobic, ionic, disulphide, H-bonds|
|**Quaternary**|Multiple chains assembled|Haemoglobin (4 subunits)|Non-covalent + disulphide bonds|

---

### 🧬 **Simple Visual – Levels of Protein Structure**

Primary → Ala—Gly—Val—Lys—Pro—
             ↓
Secondary → α-Helix / β-Sheet formation
             ↓
Tertiary → 3D folding into functional shape
             ↓
Quaternary → Assembly of multiple subunits

## 🧫 **4. Amino Acids – The Building Blocks**

Each amino acid has the general structure:
![[Pasted image 20251015020009.png]]

- The **R-group (side chain)** defines chemical behaviour.
    
- There are **20 standard amino acids**, each with unique properties.
    

---

### ✳️ **Amino Acids to Know Well**

|Amino Acid|Unique Property|Effect on Protein|
|---|---|---|
|**Glycine**|Smallest (R = H)|Fits in tight spaces, adds flexibility|
|**Proline**|R-group forms ring with N|Creates kinks, found in turns/loops|
|**Cysteine**|Contains –SH group|Forms **disulphide bonds** (–S–S–), stabilising structure|
|**Histidine**|pKa ≈ 6.5|Acts as a **pH-sensitive switch** in proteins|
|**Aspartate (Asp)**|Acidic side chain|Contributes negative charge at physiological pH|

---

### 💡 **Clinical Example: Histidine in the LDL Receptor**

`In Endosome: pH ↓ → Histidine gains H⁺ → receptor shape changes → releases LDL`

- This pH sensitivity (linked to histidine’s pKa ~6.5) allows **receptor recycling**.
    
- Mutations in these histidines → **familial hypercholesterolaemia**.
    

---

## ⚖️ **5. Acid–Base Behaviour of Amino Acids**

- **Acids donate H⁺**, **bases accept H⁺**
    
- Each ionisable group has a **pKa** value  
    → the **pH at which 50%** of molecules are dissociated.
    

### 🧮 **Henderson–Hasselbalch Equation**

![[Pasted image 20251015023158.png]]

Asp( D)
![[Pasted image 20251015023318.png]]
The equilibrium constant (K$_a$) for the reaction is defined as
![[Pasted image 20251015023256.png]]​

**Example:**

- Aspartate (COOH) → COO⁻ + H⁺ pKa ≈ 4.5  
    At pH 7.4, mostly COO⁻ → **negatively charged**
    

---

### 📊 **Conceptual Diagram – Dissociation Curve**

![[Pasted image 20251015021941.png]]

- Near pKa, small pH changes = large charge changes → alters protein shape.
    

---

## 🧱 **6. The Peptide Bond**

Formed via **condensation** between:

- Carboxyl group (–COOH) of one amino acid
    
- Amino group (–NH₂) of another
    

→ Produces **–CO–NH– (peptide bond)** + H₂O

     `O      || —C—NH—`

### ⚙️ **Key Properties**

- **Planar** (no rotation) due to partial double-bond character.
    
- Rotation occurs only around adjacent bonds → limits folding options.
    
- Backbone atoms lie in a **rigid plane**, while **R-groups alternate sides**.
    

---

### 🧩 **Visual Summary: Peptide Bond**

`Residue 1:   —C(=O)—NH—Cα— Residue 2:                  —C(=O)—NH—                  ↑              Peptide Bond`

---

## 🔄 **7. Secondary Structure**

Secondary structures are **repetitive folding patterns** stabilised by **hydrogen bonds** between backbone atoms (not R-groups).

### 🌀 **a) α-Helix**

- Right-handed coil
    
- Each turn = 3.6 residues
    
- H-bond between C=O (residue i) and N–H (residue i+4)
    

**Diagram:**

`α-Helix:           H          / —C=O···HN—C=O···HN—       ↑     ↑      H-bonds stabilize coil`

**Features:**

- R-groups project outwards → avoid clashes
    
- Common in keratin, myoglobin
    
- Disrupted by **proline** (kinks chain)
    

---

### 📄 **b) β-Sheet**

- Made of extended **β-strands** side-by-side
    
- Stabilised by **H-bonds between strands**
    

**Types:**

- **Parallel:** strands run same direction (N→C)
    
- **Antiparallel:** opposite directions (more stable)
    

**Diagram:**

`Parallel: →→→→→ →→→→→  Antiparallel: →→→→→ ←←←←←`

**Found in:** silk fibroin, immunoglobulin domains

---

### 🔁 **c) Bends and Loops**

- Allow reversal of chain direction
    
- Usually 4 amino acids long
    
- Often include **proline** and **glycine**
    

**Diagram:**

`α-helix → β-turn → β-sheet            ↑           proline (kink)`

## 🧩 **8. Summary Table – Stabilising Interactions**

|Interaction|Example|Strength|Function|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Peptide bond**|Backbone|Strong (covalent)|Chain linkage|
|**Hydrogen bond**|α-helix, β-sheet|Moderate|Stabilises folds|
|**Disulphide bond**|Between cysteines|Strong (covalent)|Stabilises tertiary structure|
|**Ionic bond**|Asp⁻ + Lys⁺|Moderate|Internal stabilisation|
|**Hydrophobic forces**|Non-polar side chains cluster|Weak individually|Drive folding|

## 🩺 **9. Clinical Relevance – Structure & Disease**

|Protein|Abnormality|Effect|
|---|---|---|
|**Haemoglobin**|Point mutation in β-chain (Glu → Val)|Sickle cell → distorted RBCs|
|**Collagen**|Defective triple helix|Ehlers–Danlos / Osteogenesis imperfecta|
|**Enzyme (general)**|Misfolding / pH sensitivity|Loss of function (e.g. enzyme deficiency)|
|**LDL receptor**|Mutation in histidine or folding site|Familial hypercholesterolaemia|

## 🧠 **10. Key Takeaways**

✅ Proteins perform all major biological functions through **specific binding**.  
✅ Their function depends directly on **structure**.  
✅ Structure arises from **amino acid sequence** and **folding forces**.  
✅ **pKa** and **local pH** affect charge and thus activity.  
✅ **Secondary structures** (α-helix, β-sheet, turns) are the foundation of 3D conformation.

## **11. Classification of Amino Acids**

![[Pasted image 20251015022021.png]]20 amino acids, classified by their properties
- hydrophobic or hydrophilic (often amino acids with a charge at neutral pH - like being in contact with aqueous environment)

![[Pasted image 20251015022249.png]]
Hydrophobic, tend to have hydrocarbon rich chain or aromatic groups, which are quite hydrophobic and non-polar

3 special cases
![[Pasted image 20251015022549.png]]
- Cysteine can for covalent disulphide (-S-S-) bonds with other cysteine residues
- Glycine is the smallest amino residue and can fit in tight spaces
	- R group only consist of single hydrogen, which hardly take any space
- The side chain of proline bends around to form a covalent bond with the nitrogen atom of the amino group. By doing this, proline creates a kink in the protein chain.
