# 🧬 **Structure of Proteins – Part 2**

**Topic focus:**  
How 3D structure determines function (and dysfunction) in real biological systems — particularly **haemoglobin** and **collagen**.

## 🧩 **1️⃣ The Tertiary Structure of Proteins**

### Definition

The **tertiary structure** is the **overall 3D shape** of a single polypeptide chain, formed when regions of **secondary structure (α-helices, β-sheets, and loops)** fold further.

---

### 🧠 Key Concepts

- **Hydrophobic residues** (non-polar side chains) → buried inside the protein core.
    
- **Hydrophilic residues** (polar/charged) → face outward into the aqueous environment.
    
- Many proteins fold into **multiple “domains”** — compact regions with distinct functions.
    

🧩 _Analogy:_  
Think of tertiary structure like **folding a long ribbon (the polypeptide)** into a 3D origami model — each fold creates a functional feature.

---

### ⚙️ **Forces That Stabilise Tertiary Structure**

|Type of Bond / Interaction|Example|Nature|Function|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Disulphide bonds (–S–S–)**|Between cysteines|Covalent (strong)|Stabilises folding, resists denaturation|
|**Hydrogen bonds**|Between polar side chains or backbone atoms|Weak, numerous|Maintain shape; form α-helices & β-sheets|
|**Ionic bonds (“salt bridges”)**|Between oppositely charged residues (e.g., Asp⁻–Lys⁺)|Moderate|Internal stabilisation, pH-dependent|
|**Hydrophobic interactions**|Between non-polar residues (Val, Leu, Phe)|Weak individually|Major driving force of folding|
|**Van der Waals forces**|Between closely packed atoms|Very weak|Fine-tune packing density|

---

### 🧬 **Disulphide Bonds – The “Molecular Safety Pins”**

- Formed when two cysteine side chains oxidise to create a **–S–S–** linkage.
    
- Covalent → much stronger than other tertiary stabilisers.
    
- Crucial for extracellular proteins (e.g., antibodies, insulin, albumin).
    

**Example:**  
**Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA)** contains **17 disulphide bridges**, providing extraordinary stability.

---

### 🧭 **Domains**

- Functional or structural subunits within a single polypeptide chain.
    
- A large protein may have several domains, each performing a separate function.  
    **Example:**
    
- Kinase domain (adds phosphate groups)
    
- Cysteine-rich domain (binding)
    
- Globin domain (oxygen transport)

### 🧩 **Simple Diagram: Folding and Domains**

`Linear chain → folds into helices/sheets → folds further → forms domains    |             |                         | Primary     Secondary                 Tertiary (3D)`

## ⚛️ **2️⃣ Quaternary Structure of Proteins**

### Definition

The **quaternary structure** is the arrangement of **multiple polypeptide chains (subunits)** into a **functional complex**.

Each subunit = one polypeptide chain.

**Example:**

- _Haemoglobin_ → 4 subunits (2α + 2β).
    
- _Insulin_ → 6 subunits (hexamer, stabilised by zinc).
    
- _Ribosome_ → ~30 different subunits.
    

---

### 💡 Key Features

- Subunits may be **identical (homomeric)** or **different (heteromeric)**.
    
- Held together by the same forces as tertiary structure (H-bonds, hydrophobic, ionic, disulphide).
    
- Enables **cooperative function** — one subunit influences another’s behaviour.
    

---

### ⚙️ **Examples**

|Protein|Number of Subunits|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|Mechanosensitive channel|7 identical|Ion flow regulation in response to stretch|
|Insulin (stored form)|6 identical (bound to Zn²⁺)|Stabilised in pancreatic vesicles|
|70S ribosome|~30 different|Massive RNA–protein complex|
|Heterotrimeric G protein|3 different|Signal transduction (α, β, γ subunits)|

---

### 🧩 **Hierarchy Summary**

`Primary → amino acid sequence Secondary → α-helices and β-sheets Tertiary → folding of one chain Quaternary → multiple folded chains forming one functional protein`

## 🩸 **3️⃣ Haemoglobin – Structure, Function & Disease**

### 🧬 **Structure**

- **4 polypeptide chains:** 2 α-globin + 2 β-globin
    
- Each chain has a **haem group** (prosthetic group) with **Fe²⁺** that binds O₂.
    
- Symmetrical, compact globular protein.
    

**Haem group structure:**

`Porphyrin ring + central Fe²⁺ ↓ Fe²⁺ binds O₂ reversibly`

Each haem molecule:

- Anchored by **Histidine F8**
    
- Oxygen binding stabilised by **Histidine E7**
    

---

### 🌬️ **Oxygen Binding – The Cooperative Curve**

- Oxygen binding is **sigmoidal (S-shaped)** — not linear.
    
- The first O₂ binds with **low affinity**, but binding causes conformational change that **increases affinity** for subsequent O₂ molecules.
    

🌀 _This is called “cooperative binding.”_

**Analogy:**  
Think of haemoglobin as a “party guest” — hesitant at first, but once one O₂ molecule joins, the others quickly follow!

---

### 🔄 **How It Works**

1. O₂ binds → Fe²⁺ and haem ring flatten slightly.
    
2. Pulls on Histidine F8 → shifts entire α-helix F.
    
3. Causes movement of adjacent subunits → increases O₂ affinity.
    

Result: **small structural change → huge functional consequence**.

---

### 📈 **Physiological Importance**

- **In lungs:** High O₂ concentration → haemoglobin binds tightly.
    
- **In tissues:** Low O₂ + higher CO₂ + lower pH → haemoglobin releases O₂.  
    This is the **Bohr effect**.
    

---

### 🧪 **Bohr Effect**

- **Low pH (acidic)** → H⁺ binds to haemoglobin → reduces O₂ affinity.
    
- **High CO₂** increases acidity → further promotes O₂ release.  
    Thus, during exercise:
    

> ↑CO₂ → ↓pH → ↑O₂ delivery to tissues.

---

### 👶 **Foetal Haemoglobin (HbF)**

- 2 α + 2 γ subunits (instead of β).
    
- Binds O₂ **more tightly** than adult haemoglobin → allows O₂ transfer across placenta.
    
- Not affected by sickle-cell mutation (γ chains lack the β-globin defect).
    

---

### 💀 **Sickle Cell Anaemia**

- Caused by **Glu → Val** mutation at position 6 of β-globin chain.
    
- Converts a **polar** residue to a **non-polar** one → hydrophobic patches form → haemoglobin molecules **aggregate** into stiff fibres.
    
- RBCs distort into **sickle shape**, clogging vessels and haemolysing.
    

**Result:**  
Pain crises, anaemia, and organ damage.

## 🦴 **4️⃣ Collagen – Structure, Function & Disease**

### 🧬 **Function**

- Major **structural protein** of connective tissues (skin, bone, tendon, cartilage).
    
- Makes up ~25% of total body protein.
    
- Provides **tensile strength** and **support**.
    

---

### 🧩 **Structure**

- Basic unit = **tropocollagen**.
    
- Composed of **3 polypeptide chains** twisted into a **triple helix**.
    
    - Each chain = left-handed helix
        
    - Triple helix = right-handed supercoil
        

`[Chain] + [Chain] + [Chain] → Triple helix (tropocollagen)`

---

### 🔬 **Role of Key Amino Acids**

|Amino Acid|Role in Structure|
|---|---|
|**Glycine**|Smallest side chain → allows tight packing (every 3rd residue is Gly)|
|**Proline**|Forces left-hand twist → rigidity|
|**Hydroxyproline**|Forms strong hydrogen bonds → stabilises triple helix|
|**Lysine (and derivatives)**|Forms **cross-links** between molecules → gives tensile strength|

---

### ⚙️ **Cross-linking and Fibre Formation**

- **Lysine residues** converted to **allysine** by **lysyl oxidase**.
    
- **Aldol condensation** reactions create **covalent cross-links** → “stitch” collagen molecules together.
    
- Arrangement = “**quarter-stagger model**” → staggered alignment provides strength and flexibility.
    

---

### 🧩 **Visual Summary**

`α-chains → Triple helix (tropocollagen) ↓ Tropocollagen units cross-link → Collagen fibrils ↓ Fibrils bundle → Collagen fibre`

---

### ⚕️ **Clinical Correlations**

|Disease|Cause|Effect|
|---|---|---|
|**Osteogenesis imperfecta**|Gly → Cys mutation|Tropocollagen misfolding → weak bones|
|**Scurvy**|Vitamin C deficiency|Impaired proline hydroxylation → weak collagen|
|**Ehlers–Danlos syndrome**|Lysyl oxidase or procollagen peptidase defect|Hypermobile joints, loose skin|

---

### 🧩 **Case Example**

**Susan M., 3 years old:**

- Repeated fractures, skeletal deformities.
    
- Genetic testing → Gly → Cys mutation in collagen α-chain.
    
- Diagnosis: **Osteogenesis Imperfecta (brittle bone disease)**.
    

**Mechanism:**  
Cysteine’s larger side chain disrupts tight packing → triple helix unstable → defective collagen fibres.
