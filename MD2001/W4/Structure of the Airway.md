## Conducting vs. Respiratory Portions

### 1.1. Conducting Portion

- The conducting portion of the respiratory system includes the **nose, nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, pharynx (nasopharynx, oropharynx, laryngopharynx), larynx, trachea, bronchi, bronchial tree, and terminal bronchioles**.
    
- These structures primarily serve to **transport, warm, humidify, and filter air** before it reaches the gas exchange surfaces.
    

### 1.2. Respiratory Portion

- The respiratory portion, where gas exchange occurs, consists of the **respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, and alveoli**.
    
- The lungs contain approximately **400 million alveoli**, providing a **large surface area** for efficient gas exchange and are supported by a **rich vascular supply**.
    

## Nasal Cavity Anatomy

### 2.1. External Nose and Cavity Boundaries

- The external nose is composed of **hyaline cartilage, muscle, soft tissue, and the nasal bone**. The **nares (nostrils)** open into the **nasal cavities**.
    
- The nasal cavities are bilateral and serve to **warm, humidify, and filter inhaled air**.
    

### 2.2. Walls of the Nasal Cavity

- **Floor**: Formed by the **hard and soft palate**.
    
- **Lateral Wall**: Composed of the **ethmoid bone (superior and middle conchae), inferior nasal concha, maxilla, sphenoid, palatine bone, lacrimal bone, and nasal bone**.
    
- **Medial Wall (Nasal Septum)**: Formed by the **septal cartilage, ethmoid bone (perpendicular plate), and vomer**.
    
- **Roof**: Includes the **frontal bone, ethmoid bone (cribriform plate), and sphenoid bone**. The roof also contains specialized **olfactory mucosa**.
    

### 2.3. Olfactory Anatomy

- **Olfactory Nerve (CN I)**: Responsible for the sense of smell.
    
- **Olfactory Pathway**: Olfactory mucosa → olfactory nerves (passing through the cribriform plate) → olfactory bulb → olfactory tract → medial and lateral striae → piriform cortices.
    

### 2.4. Respiratory Mucosa

- The respiratory mucosa is composed of **ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium with goblet cells**.
    
- It is supported by a **rich vascular supply and submucosal glands**.
    
- **Function**: Mucus traps foreign particles, and cilia move the mucus out of the airway.
    

### 2.5. Innervation

- **Special Sensory**: CN I (olfactory nerve).
    
- **Somatic Sensory**: CN V1 and V2 (ophthalmic and maxillary divisions of the trigeminal nerve).
    
- **Autonomic**:
    
    - Parasympathetic: CN VII (facial nerve) provides secretomotor innervation.
        
    - Sympathetic: Via peri-arterial fibers from the superior cervical ganglion.
        

### 2.6. Arterial Supply

- The nasal cavity has a **rich vascular supply** with anastomoses between branches of the external and internal carotid arteries.
    
- **Internal Carotid Artery (ICA)**:
    
    - Ophthalmic artery → anterior and posterior ethmoidal arteries.
        
- **External Carotid Artery (ECA)**:
    
    - Maxillary artery → sphenopalatine and descending palatine arteries → greater palatine artery.
        
    - Facial artery → superior labial artery → nasal branches.
        

### 2.7. Form to Function

- **Turbinates (nasal conchae + mucosa)**: Aid in warming and humidifying air by increasing surface area and vascularity.
    
- **Turbulent Flow**: Aids in filtering particles via "turbulent precipitation."
    
- **Mucus and Cilia**: Clear trapped particles from the nasal cavity. Smoking impairs ciliary function.
    

## Paranasal Sinuses

### 3.1. Overview

- The paranasal sinuses are **epithelium-lined cavities within the facial bones** surrounding the nasal cavities.
    
- These include the **frontal, sphenoidal, maxillary, and ethmoidal sinuses (anterior, middle, and posterior ethmoidal cells)**.
    
- They drain into the lateral aspect of the nasal cavity. The **maxillary sinus** is particularly prone to sinusitis.
    

### 3.2. Sinus Drainage

- Sinuses drain into the nasal cavity via spaces called **meatuses** located below each concha.
    
- **Drainage Sites**:
    
    - Superior Meatus: Posterior ethmoidal sinus.
        
    - Middle Meatus: Frontal, anterior and middle ethmoidal, and maxillary sinuses.
        
    - Spheno-ethmoidal Recess: Sphenoidal sinus.
        
    - Inferior Meatus: Nasolacrimal duct (not a sinus).
        

### 3.3. Clinical Considerations

- Common conditions include:
    
- **Nosebleed (Epistaxis)**
    
- **Inflammation (e.g., allergic rhinitis)**
    
- **Deviated Septum**
    
- **Sinusitis**
    
- **Upper Respiratory Tract Infections (URTI)**
    
- **Infection Tracking**
    
- **CSF Rhinorrhea**: Can occur following major trauma.
    

## Pharynx

### 4.1. Overview

- The pharynx is a **fibromuscular tube** extending from the base of the skull to the esophagus.
    
- It is divided into three parts: **nasopharynx, oropharynx, and laryngopharynx**.
    

### 4.2. Function

- Composed of **six muscles per side**: three constrictors and three longitudinal muscles.
    
- **Functions**:
    
    - Conducts air from the nasopharynx to the larynx.
        
    - Conducts food and liquid from the oropharynx to the esophagus.
        

## Larynx

### 5.1. Overview

- The larynx is composed of **muscle, cartilage, and ligaments/membranes**.
    
- Located in the anterior neck, spanning the C3-C6 vertebral levels.
    

### 5.2. Functions

- **Airway Protection**: Guards the airway during swallowing.
    
- **Phonation**: Production of voice.
    
- **Increase Intra-abdominal Pressure**: Allows voluntary increase in intra-abdominal pressure (e.g., during Valsalva maneuver).
    

### 5.3. Cartilages

- **Unpaired Cartilages**: Thyroid, cricoid, and epiglottic.
    
- **Paired Cartilages**: Arytenoids, corniculate, and cuneiform.
    
- **Composition**: All are hyaline cartilage except the epiglottis, which is elastic cartilage.
    

### 5.4. Ligaments and Membranes

- Cartilages are joined by various ligaments and membranes, all covered by mucosa.
    
- **Aryepiglottic Ligament**: Forms the aryepiglottic fold.
    
- **Vestibular Folds (False Vocal Cords)**: Mucosa covering the vestibular ligaments (inferior margin of quadrangular membrane).
    

### 5.5. Folds and Spaces

- **Vestibular Folds**: False vocal cords.
    
- **Vocal Folds**: True vocal cords.
    
- **Laryngeal Ventricle**: Space between the vestibular and vocal folds.
    
- **Rima Glottidis**: Space between the vocal folds.
    

### 5.6. Musculature

- Muscles between the cartilaginous skeleton allow voluntary and involuntary function of the larynx.
    
- **Functions**:
    
    - Tensing the vocal ligament.
        
    - Abducting vocal folds.
        
    - Adducting arytenoids, closing the posterior rima glottidis.
        
    - Adducting vocal folds.
        
    - Relaxing the vocal ligament.
        

### 5.7. Airway Protection

- Several laryngeal muscles act together to pull aryepiglottic folds together and pull arytenoids towards the epiglottis.
    
- **Mechanism**:
    
    - Arytenoid cartilages are drawn/tilted anteriorly.
        
    - Entire larynx elevates during swallowing (via pharyngeal elevators and muscles elevating the hyoid).
        
    - Epiglottis inverts during swallowing.
        

### 5.8. Phonation

- Involves altering the tension of vocal cords to change pitch and altering the position of vocal cords to change volume (i.e., size of rima glottidis).
    
- **Whispering**: Lateral crico-arytenoids contract to adduct cords, but the transverse arytenoid remains relaxed, so cartilages are not fully adducted.
    

### 5.9. Innervation

- **Vagus Nerve (CN X)**:
    
    - Superior Laryngeal Branch:
        
    - Internal Laryngeal Nerve: Sensory above the vocal cords.
        
    - External Laryngeal Nerve: Motor to the cricothyroid muscle.
        
    - Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve: Motor to all other laryngeal muscles and sensory to the vocal cords and below.
        
    - Structures the recurrent laryngeal nerve loops around are important clinically.
        

### 5.10. Blood Supply and Lymphatics

- **Arterial Supply**:
    
    - Superior Thyroid Artery: Branch of the external carotid artery.
        
    - Inferior Thyroid Artery: From the thyrocervical trunk, a branch of the subclavian artery.
        
- **Venous Drainage**:
    
    - Superior, middle, and inferior thyroid veins drain into the internal jugular and brachiocephalic trunks.
        
- **Lymphatic Drainage**:
    
    - Above Vocal Folds: Superior deep cervical lymph nodes.
        
    - Below Vocal Folds: Pretracheal or paratracheal → inferior deep cervical nodes.
        

## Trachea

### 6.1. Overview

- The trachea is a **fibrous and cartilaginous tube** that conducts air from the larynx to the bronchi.
    
- Approximately **2.5 cm in diameter**, extending from C6 to the T4/5 intervertebral disc level.
    
- Features **C-shaped cartilage rings** to maintain patency.
    
- Posteriorly, smooth muscle called the **trachealis muscle** joins the ends of the cartilage rings.
    

## Clinical Considerations

- **Choking**: Emergency requiring clearance of obstruction via cough encouragement, back blows, or abdominal thrusts.
    
- **Anaphylaxis**: Laryngeal angioedema that requires epinephrine.
    
- **Laryngospasm**: Surgical consideration triggering inappropriate laryngeal closure reflex.
    
- **Aspiration Pneumonia**: Result of chronic dysphagia/laryngeal dysfunction.
    
- **Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve Damage**: Can result from surgery (iatrogenic) or tumor, leading to a hoarse voice.
