## 🩸 **1. Meaning and Overview**

**Chronic inflammation** = inflammation that **persists for months or years**.

Unlike acute inflammation (which is short and dramatic), chronic inflammation is **smouldering** — damage, inflammation, and healing all occur **simultaneously**.

**Key cells involved:**

- **Macrophages** – the central players (present in both acute and chronic phases)
    
- **Lymphocytes**
    
- **Plasma cells**
    

📍 **Think of it like:**  
Acute inflammation is a **flash fire** — fast, bright, short.  
Chronic inflammation is a **slow-burning ember** — persistent and damaging over time.

## 🔄 **2. Sequelae (Outcomes) of Acute Inflammation**

After acute inflammation, one of three things can happen:

|Outcome|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|**Resolution**|Complete healing, normal structure restored|Mild pneumonia, sunburn|
|**Abscess formation**|Pus collection|Boil, dental abscess|
|**Progression to chronic inflammation**|Ongoing injury or infection|TB, hepatitis, rheumatoid arthritis|

---

## 🌿 **3. Factors Promoting Resolution (Healing)**

Resolution depends on how efficiently the body removes the injury.

|Favourable Factor|Explanation|
|---|---|
|Minimal tissue damage|Less to repair|
|Good regenerative capacity|Organs like liver and skin heal well|
|Rapid elimination of cause|Quick clearance = less damage|
|Good blood supply|Brings nutrients and immune cells|
|Good nutrition & immune status|Supports regeneration|

💡 _Clinical link:_ Poor nutrition (vitamin deficiencies, diabetes, immunosuppression) impairs healing and encourages chronicity.

---

## 🧫 **4. Granulation Tissue (The Healing Scaffold)**

**Definition:**  
Granulation tissue forms during the healing phase — it’s new connective tissue and tiny blood vessels growing to repair damage.

**Components:**

- **Macrophages** → clean up debris (“site managers”)
    
- **Fibroblasts** → produce collagen (“builders”)
    
- **New capillaries** → supply nutrients and oxygen (“delivery trucks”)
    

**End result:** healing, often with some **scarring (fibrosis)**.

🧠 _Analogy:_ Granulation tissue is like the **scaffolding and repair crew** that rebuilds a damaged structure.

## ⚡ **5. Causes of Chronic Inflammation**

### **A. Primary Chronic Inflammation**

Occurs **without an acute stage** first.

|Mechanism|Example|
|---|---|
|Persistent infection with resistant organisms|**Tuberculosis (Mycobacterium tuberculosis)**|
|Prolonged exposure to toxic agents|**Asbestos** in lungs|
|Autoimmune disease|**Rheumatoid arthritis**, **Inflammatory bowel disease**, **Leprosy**|

---

### **B. Secondary Chronic Inflammation**

Follows an **acute episode** that fails to resolve.

|Mechanism|Example|
|---|---|
|Poor clearance of infection|**Osteomyelitis** (bone infection)|
|Repeated acute episodes|**Chronic cholecystitis**, **chronic pyelonephritis**, **gout**|

🧠 _Analogy:_ Think of it like a fire that flares up again and again because the cause (infection, irritation) was never completely removed.

---

## 🧬 **6. Example: Tuberculosis (Primary Chronic Inflammation)**

**Pathogen:** _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_

**Mechanism:**

1. Bacteria are taken up by **macrophages**, but resist destruction (waxy wall).
    
2. Macrophages fuse → **Langerhans giant cells**.
    
3. Tissue damage due to leakage of lysosomal enzymes.
    
4. Body attempts to “wall off” infection → **granuloma formation**.
    

**Histology:**

- Central **caseous (“cheese-like”) necrosis**
    
- Surrounding **macrophages**, **giant cells**
    
- Outer rim of **lymphocytes and plasma cells**
    

📍 _Important distinction:_  
**Granuloma ≠ Granulation tissue**

- _Granuloma:_ inflammation (macrophages + lymphocytes, often necrotic).
    
- _Granulation tissue:_ healing (fibroblasts + new vessels).
    

**Complications:**

- Spread to other organs (bone, CNS, kidney)
    
- Especially severe in **HIV or malnourished** patients

## 🦴 **7. Chronic Inflammation Progressing from Acute Inflammation**

### Example: **Osteomyelitis**

- Bone infection often starts acutely.
    
- Poor blood flow prevents pus drainage → necrosis of bone.
    
- Dead bone acts as a **foreign body**, maintaining chronic inflammation.
    

**Microscopy:**  
Mixed inflammatory infiltrate (macrophages, lymphocytes, fibroblasts) and fibrosis.

---

### Example: **Chronic Viral Hepatitis (B or C)**

- Initially acute (jaundice, fever, malaise)
    
- If not cleared → becomes chronic
    
- **Macrophages and lymphocytes** infiltrate the liver
    
- Ongoing inflammation → fibrosis → **cirrhosis**
    

🧠 _Analogy:_ A chronic viral infection is like rust on metal — slow, continuous damage.

---

## 🪨 **8. Chronic Inflammation from Recurrent Acute Episodes**

### Example: **Chronic Cholecystitis**

- Repeated inflammation due to **gallstones** or infection.
    
- Chronic irritation → thickened wall (fibrosis).
    
- **Macrophages, plasma cells, fibroblasts** dominate.
    
- May form **granulomas** with **giant cells**.
    

### Example: **Gout**

- Recurrent deposition of **uric acid crystals** in joints.
    
- Each flare = acute inflammation.
    
- Repeated episodes → chronic inflammation and fibrosis.

## 🌡 **9. Systemic Consequences of Chronic Inflammation**

|Effect|Mechanism / Mediator|
|---|---|
|**Fever, malaise, weight loss**|Cytokines (IL-1, TNF)|
|**Fibrosis and scarring**|Fibroblast activation and collagen deposition|
|**Anaemia of chronic disease**|IL-6 → ↑ hepcidin → ↓ iron absorption/release|
|**Amyloidosis**|Chronic overproduction of serum amyloid A → insoluble protein deposits|
|**Growth retardation in children**|Catabolic cytokine effects|

🧠 _Clinical link:_  
CRP and ESR are raised in chronic inflammation due to ongoing cytokine activity.

---

## ⚠️ **10. Risk of Malignancy in Chronic Inflammation**

**Why?**

- Macrophages release **TNF** and **peroxynitrite**, causing DNA damage.
    
- Ongoing cell turnover → mutation accumulation (“multi-hit” process).
    
- Eventually → dysplasia → carcinoma.
    

**Examples:**

|Site|Inflammatory Cause|Cancer|
|---|---|---|
|Stomach|_Helicobacter pylori_ gastritis|Gastric adenocarcinoma|
|Cervix|Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection|Cervical cancer|
|Liver|Hepatitis B & C|Hepatocellular carcinoma|
|Colon|Inflammatory bowel disease|Colorectal cancer|

🧠 _Analogy:_ Chronic inflammation is like a faulty repair crew — every time they fix damage, they might make small DNA “mistakes,” which over time can lead to cancer.

---

## 🧩 **11. Cells of Chronic Inflammation**

|Cell Type|Function|
|---|---|
|**Macrophages**|Central to chronic inflammation; phagocytose debris, release cytokines (IL-1, TNF), promote fibrosis|
|**Lymphocytes**|Coordinate immune response, release cytokines (IFN-γ) to activate macrophages|
|**Plasma cells**|Produce antibodies against persistent antigens|
|**Fibroblasts**|Lay down collagen → fibrosis/scarring|

---

## 🧠 **12. Summary Table: Acute vs Chronic Inflammation**

|Feature|Acute|Chronic|
|---|---|---|
|Duration|Minutes–days|Weeks–years|
|Cells|Neutrophils|Macrophages, lymphocytes, plasma cells|
|Vascular changes|Prominent|Less marked|
|Outcome|Resolution or abscess|Fibrosis, scarring, tissue destruction|
|Example|Pneumonia|TB, rheumatoid arthritis|
