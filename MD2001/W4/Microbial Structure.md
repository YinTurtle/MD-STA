## Overview: The Six Main Groups of Microorganisms

Think of microorganisms as different types of vehicles - they all move and function, but their internal machinery is completely different.

**Size comparison (smallest to largest):** Viruses → Bacteria → Yeasts → Protozoa → Fungi → Helminths

## 1. PROKARYOTES vs EUKARYOTES: The Fundamental Divide

### The Apartment Analogy

- **Prokaryotes** (bacteria) = studio apartment - everything in one open space, no separate rooms
- **Eukaryotes** (fungi, protozoa, helminths, human cells) = house with separate rooms for different functions

### Key Structural Differences

|Feature|Prokaryotes|Eukaryotes|
|---|---|---|
|**Nucleus**|No membrane-bound nucleus - DNA floats in nucleoid region|True nucleus with nuclear membrane|
|**DNA structure**|Single circular chromosome, supercoiled|Multiple linear chromosomes with histones|
|**Organelles**|None (no mitochondria, ER, Golgi)|Mitochondria, ER, Golgi, lysosomes, etc.|
|**Ribosomes**|70S (smaller: 30S + 50S subunits)|80S (larger: 40S + 60S subunits)|
|**Size**|0.5-5 μm|10-100 μm|
|**Cell division**|Binary fission (simple splitting)|Mitosis/meiosis (complex)|
|**Cell wall**|Peptidoglycan (bacteria)|Chitin (fungi), cellulose (plants), or none|

### **Clinical Implications for Treatment**

This difference is why antibiotics work!

- **Target 70S ribosomes**: Tetracyclines, aminoglycosides, macrolides - kill bacteria but spare human cells
- **Target peptidoglycan synthesis**: Penicillins, cephalosporins - bacteria have it, we don't
- **Target bacterial DNA gyrase**: Quinolones - different from human enzymes
- **Problem with antifungals**: Fungi are eukaryotes like us, so harder to target without toxicity

## 2. BACTERIA: Detailed Structure

### Bacterial Cell Morphologies & Arrangements

**Shape (Morphology):**

- **Coccus** (plural: cocci) = sphere/ball
- **Bacillus** (plural: bacilli) = rod
- **Spirillum** = rigid spiral
- **Spirochete** = flexible spiral
- **Vibrio** = comma-shaped

**Arrangements:**

- **-coccus** alone = single sphere
- **Diplo-** = pairs (e.g., _Diplococcus_)
- **Strepto-** = chains (like pearls on a string) (e.g., _Streptococcus_)
- **Staphylo-** = clusters (like grapes) (e.g., _Staphylococcus_)
- **Tetrad** = groups of 4
- **Sarcina** = cubes of 8

**Examples:**

- _Staphylococcus aureus_ = grape-like clusters of spheres
- _Streptococcus pyogenes_ = chains of spheres
- _Escherichia coli_ = single rods
- _Bacillus anthracis_ = chains of rods

## 3. THE GRAM STAIN: Understanding Cell Envelopes

### The Gram-Positive Envelope (Think: Thick Castle Wall)

**Layers from inside out:**

1. **Plasma membrane** (phospholipid bilayer)
2. **THICK peptidoglycan layer** (20-80 nm) - this is KEY
3. Teichoic acids and lipoteichoic acids (extending through and anchored to membrane)

**Analogy**: Like a castle with ONE massive stone wall

### The Gram-Negative Envelope (Think: Double Wall with Space Between)

**Layers from inside out:**

1. **Inner membrane** (plasma membrane)
2. **Periplasmic space** (contains proteins and enzymes)
3. **THIN peptidoglycan layer** (2-3 nm) - much thinner!
4. **Outer membrane** (lipopolysaccharide/LPS on outside, phospholipids on inside)
    - LPS = endotoxin (causes septic shock)
    - Porins (channels for nutrients)

**Analogy**: Like a castle with TWO thinner walls with a courtyard (periplasm) between them

### Why the Gram Stain Works: The Molecular Explanation

**The Process:**

1. **Crystal violet** (purple dye) enters all bacteria
2. **Iodine** added - forms large crystal violet-iodine complexes inside cells
3. **Alcohol decolorizer** added - this is the critical step!

**Gram-POSITIVE (Purple):**

- Thick peptidoglycan = small pore size
- Alcohol dehydrates the thick peptidoglycan, making pores even SMALLER
- Large crystal violet-iodine complexes TRAPPED inside
- **Result: Stays purple**

**Gram-NEGATIVE (Pink):**

- Thin peptidoglycan can't trap the dye
- Alcohol dissolves the outer membrane lipids
- Crystal violet-iodine complexes wash OUT
- Counterstain (safranin/fuchsin - pink) applied
- **Result: Appears pink/red**

**Memory trick**: Gram-**POS**itive = **P**urple with **P**lenty of **P**eptidoglycan

## 4. BACTERIAL APPENDAGES & SURFACE STRUCTURES

Think of these as bacterial tools and weapons.

### Flagella (Singular: Flagellum)

- **Structure**: Long whip-like tail made of flagellin protein
- **Function**: Motility (movement)
- **Powered by**: Proton-motive force (like a rotary motor - spins!)
- **Arrangements**:
    - Monotrichous = single flagellum
    - Lophotrichous = tuft at one end
    - Amphitrichous = flagella at both ends
    - Peritrichous = flagella all around
- **Clinical**: H antigen (_E. coli_), helps bacteria swim toward nutrients, away from toxins

### Pili (Fimbriae when multiple)

- **Structure**: Hair-like protein projections, shorter and thinner than flagella
- **Function**: **Attachment to host cells** (key for colonization!)
- **Example**: _E. coli_ pili attach to bladder epithelium → UTI

### Sex Pilus (F pilus)

- **Structure**: Longer, fewer per cell
- **Function**: **Conjugation** - forms bridge between bacteria for DNA transfer
- **Clinical significance**: How antibiotic resistance spreads!

### Glycocalyx (Sugar Coat)

Two types:

**Capsule:**

- Organized, firmly attached polysaccharide layer
- **Function**: Protects from phagocytosis (immune evasion!)
- **Example**: _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ - unencapsulated strains are non-pathogenic
- **Clinical**: Capsular polysaccharide vaccines (pneumococcal vaccine)

**Slime layer:**

- Loose, unorganized
- **Function**: Biofilm formation
- **Example**: _Staphylococcus epidermidis_ on catheters - protects bacteria from antibiotics

## 5. BACTERIAL REPRODUCTION & GENETIC TRANSFER

### Binary Fission (Normal Reproduction)

1. DNA replicates
2. Cell elongates
3. Septum forms down the middle
4. Two identical daughter cells

**Time**: Can occur every 20 minutes under ideal conditions! **Result**: Exponential growth (1→2→4→8→16...)

### Horizontal Gene Transfer (Bacteria Sharing Genetic Information)

Think of this as bacteria "texting" each other genetic information - this is how antibiotic resistance spreads!

**1. Transformation**

- Bacteria pick up "naked" DNA from environment (e.g., from dead bacteria)
- **Clinical example**: How _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ acquired penicillin resistance

**2. Transduction**

- Bacteriophage (virus) transfers DNA between bacteria
- **Mechanism**: Virus packages bacterial DNA by mistake, injects it into next cell
- **Clinical example**: Toxin genes transferred (diphtheria toxin, cholera toxin)

**3. Conjugation** (Most important clinically)

- Direct transfer through sex pilus
- Plasmids transferred (often carry antibiotic resistance genes)
- **Clinical example**: Spread of multi-drug resistance in hospitals
- **F (fertility) plasmid** = contains genes for pilus formation

## 6. VIRUSES: Unique Structural Features

### Why Viruses Are Different

**NOT cells!** - they're obligate intracellular parasites

**Think of viruses as**: Genetic instructions wrapped in a protein box, sometimes with a lipid gift wrap

### Basic Viral Structure

**Three essential components:**

**1. Genetic Material (Core)**

- **DNA or RNA** (never both!)
- Can be:
    - Single-stranded (ss) or double-stranded (ds)
    - Linear or circular
    - Segmented or non-segmented
- **Location**: Inside the capsid

**2. Capsid**

- **Protein coat** made of repeating subunits called **capsomeres**
- **Shape types**:
    - **Icosahedral** (20 sides) - e.g., adenovirus, poliovirus
    - **Helical** (spiral) - e.g., rabies, measles
    - **Complex** - e.g., bacteriophages, poxviruses
- **Function**: Protects genetic material, helps attach to host cells

**3. Envelope (Some viruses only)**

- **Lipid bilayer** stolen from host cell membrane
- **Studded with viral glycoproteins** (spikes)
- **Examples**: HIV, influenza, herpes, coronaviruses
- **Non-enveloped examples**: Adenovirus, poliovirus, norovirus

**Clinical importance of envelope:**

- **Enveloped viruses**: More fragile, destroyed by soap/alcohol (lipids dissolve)
- **Non-enveloped**: More stable, resist hand sanitizer, need bleach or strong detergents

## 7. VIRAL REPLICATION vs BACTERIAL REPRODUCTION

### Bacterial Reproduction (Independent)

- Makes its own proteins
- Has ribosomes
- Generates its own energy
- **Binary fission** - splits in two
- Can grow on agar plates

### Viral Replication (Completely Dependent)

**The Hijacking Analogy**: Virus is like a USB drive with malicious code - needs to plug into a computer (host cell) to run its program

**Steps (using bacteriophage as example):**

1. **Attachment (Adsorption)**
    - Viral proteins bind to specific host receptors
    - **Specificity** determines host range
2. **Penetration**
    - Virus or viral genetic material enters cell
    - Bacteriophages inject DNA (like a syringe)
    - Animal viruses: fusion or endocytosis
3. **Uncoating** (animal viruses)
    - Capsid removed, releasing genetic material
4. **Synthesis**
    - Viral genes hijack host machinery
    - Host ribosomes make viral proteins
    - Viral genome replicates
5. **Assembly**
    - New viral particles assembled
    - Capsids form around genetic material
6. **Release**
    - **Lysis**: Cell bursts (bacteriophages, non-enveloped)
    - **Budding**: Enveloped viruses exit by wrapping themselves in membrane (cell survives longer)

**Key difference**: Bacteria multiply by division; viruses are ASSEMBLED like cars in a factory

## 8. FUNGI & YEASTS

### Fungi: The Big Picture

- **Eukaryotic**
- **Cell wall**: Chitin (not peptidoglycan!)
- **Heterotrophs**: Absorb nutrients from environment

### Two Main Growth Forms

**Yeasts**

- **Single-celled**, round/oval
- **Reproduction**: Budding (asymmetric division)
    - Small bud grows from parent cell
    - Nucleus divides
    - Bud pinches off
- **Example**: _Candida albicans_, _Saccharomyces_ (baker's yeast)
- **Clinical**: Thrush, vaginal yeast infections

**Molds (Filamentous fungi)**

- **Multicellular**, branching filaments called **hyphae**
- Network of hyphae = **mycelium**
- **Reproduction**:
    - Asexual: spores (conidia)
    - Sexual: fusion of specialized structures
- **Examples**: _Aspergillus_, dermatophytes (ringworm)

**Dimorphic fungi** (Important for exams!)

- Can switch between yeast and mold forms
- Usually: Mold in environment (25°C), yeast in body (37°C)
- **Examples**: _Histoplasma_, _Coccidioides_

## 9. PROTOZOA

### Key Features

- **Single-celled eukaryotes**
- **Motile** (most)
- **Heterotrophs**
- **Complex life cycles** (often multiple hosts)

### Locomotion Structures

**Flagella** (Eukaryotic type - different from bacterial!)

- "9+2" microtubule arrangement
- Whip-like beating
- **Example**: _Giardia lamblia_, _Trypanosoma_

**Cilia**

- Short, numerous hair-like projections
- Coordinated beating (like a wave)
- **Example**: _Balantidium coli_

**Pseudopodia** ("False feet")

- Cytoplasmic extensions
- Amoeboid movement
- **Example**: _Entamoeba histolytica_

**No specialized locomotion**

- **Apicomplexa** (have apical complex for invasion)
- **Example**: _Plasmodium_ (malaria), _Toxoplasma_

## 10. HELMINTHS (Parasitic Worms)

### Key Features

- **Multicellular eukaryotes**
- **Macroscopic** (visible to naked eye)
- Complex organ systems
- **Not microorganisms technically**, but studied in microbiology because they cause infectious disease

### Two Main Groups

**Nematodes (Roundworms)**

- Cylindrical, tapered ends
- Complete digestive system
- **Examples**:
    - _Ascaris lumbricoides_ (largest intestinal parasite)
    - Hookworms
    - Pinworms (_Enterobius_)

**Platyhelminthes (Flatworms)**

_Cestodes (Tapeworms):_

- Flat, segmented (proglottids)
- No digestive system (absorb nutrients across body wall)
- **Scolex** (head) with hooks/suckers for attachment
- **Example**: _Taenia_ (beef/pork tapeworm)

_Trematodes (Flukes):_

- Leaf-shaped, non-segmented
- Have digestive system
- **Suckers** for attachment
- **Example**: _Schistosoma_ (blood flukes)

### Reproduction

- **Complex life cycles** with multiple stages
- Often require **intermediate hosts**
- Produce **eggs or larvae** (diagnostic stage)
- Sexual reproduction (most are hermaphroditic)

## Clinical Pearls for Revision

1. **Gram stain predicts antibiotic choice**: Gram-positive → beta-lactams work well; Gram-negative → need drugs that penetrate outer membrane
2. **Capsules = virulence**: Encapsulated bacteria evade phagocytosis (_S. pneumoniae_, _H. influenzae_, _N. meningitidis_)
3. **Endotoxin (LPS) is only in Gram-negatives**: Causes septic shock
4. **Horizontal gene transfer = resistance spread**: Especially conjugation in hospitals
5. **Enveloped viruses are fragile**: Hand sanitizer works; non-enveloped need soap and water
6. **Fungal infections in immunocompromised**: Fungi are everywhere but usually harmless unless immune system fails
