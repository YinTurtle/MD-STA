## Overview of Respiratory System

### Two Main Components

**1. Conducting Portion (No gas exchange):**

- Nose, nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses
- Pharynx (nasopharynx, oropharynx, laryngopharynx)
- Larynx
- Trachea
- Bronchi and bronchial tree
- Terminal bronchioles

**Function**: Transport air to and from gas exchange areas

**2. Respiratory Portion (Gas exchange occurs here):**

- Respiratory bronchioles
- Alveolar ducts and sacs
- **Alveoli**: ~400 million per lung!
- Large surface area (75-100 m²)
- Rich vascular supply

---

## The Trachea

### Basic Structure

**Definition**: Fibrous and cartilaginous tube conducting air from larynx to bronchi

**Key dimensions:**

- **Length**: ~10 cm
- **Diameter**: ~2.5 cm
- **Location**: C6 to T4/5 vertebral levels
- **Bifurcation**: At T4/5 (level of manubriosternal joint/angle of Louis)

**Structural features:**

- **C-shaped cartilage rings** - maintain patency (keep airway open)
    - Incomplete posteriorly (open part faces esophagus)
- **Trachealis muscle**: Smooth muscle posteriorly
    - Connects ends of cartilage rings
    - Controls tracheal diameter
    - Allows esophagus to expand during swallowing

**Clinical point**: The C-shape (not complete rings) allows the esophagus to expand when swallowing food

---

### Surrounding Structures (Important for Clinical Context)

**Posterior:**

- Esophagus (directly behind)

**Anterior:**

- Sternothyroid and sternohyoid muscles
- **Thyroid gland**:
    - 1st cartilage ring is palpable
    - Thyroid obscures rings 2-4
- Brachiocephalic trunk
- Cardiac plexus nerves
- Tracheobronchial lymph nodes
- Manubrium

**Lateral:**

- Thyroid gland lobes
- Parathyroid glands
- Common carotid arteries
- Left: Aortic arch, left common carotid and subclavian arteries
- Right: Azygos arch, vagus nerve

**Posterolateral:**

- **Recurrent laryngeal nerves** (both sides)
    - **Clinical relevance**: Can be damaged during thyroid surgery → hoarseness/voice changes

**At bifurcation:**

- **Carina** forms - the ridge where trachea divides
- Very sensitive - triggers cough reflex

---

## Bronchi and Bronchial Tree

### Hierarchy of Airways

**Primary (Main) Bronchi:**

- Right and left
- Continuation of trachea
- Have **smooth muscle** and **complete cartilage rings**

**Key anatomical difference:**

- **Right main bronchus**: Wider, shorter, more vertical
    - **Clinical significance**: Foreign bodies more likely to enter right side
- **Left main bronchus**: Narrower, longer, more horizontal

**Secondary (Lobar) Bronchi:**

- **Right**: 3 (supply 3 lobes)
- **Left**: 2 (supply 2 lobes)

**Tertiary (Segmental) Bronchi:**

- **10 per lung** (supply bronchopulmonary segments)
- **Clinical relevance**: Segments are surgical units - can remove individual segments

**Blood supply to bronchi:**

- **Bronchial arteries**: 1 right, 2 left
- Supply structural tissues of airways

---

### Bronchioles

**Structure:**

- Serial divisions: **20-25 generations**
- As number increases → individual size decreases BUT total surface area increases
- **Total surface area: 75-100 m²**

**Key structural differences from bronchi:**

- **Smooth muscle present**
- **NO cartilage** (important!)
- **NO glands**

**Progression:** Conducting bronchioles → Terminal bronchioles → **Respiratory bronchioles** → Alveolar ducts → Alveolar sacs → Alveoli

---

## Alveoli - The Gas Exchange Units

### Structure

**Numbers**: ~400 million per lung

**Key features:**

- **Single cell thick** (Type I pneumocytes)
- Surrounded by **capillary beds**
- **Massive surface area** with **thin walls** = efficient gas exchange

**Blood supply:**

- Pulmonary vasculature branches similarly to bronchial tree
- Forms dense capillary networks around alveoli

---

## Histology of the Respiratory Tree

### Respiratory Epithelium (Throughout Most of Tract)

**Type**: Pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium with goblet cells

**Key cell types:**

- **Ciliated columnar cells**: Move mucus upward (mucociliary escalator)
- **Goblet cells**: Produce mucus
- **Basal cells**: Stem cells

**Function**: Trap and remove particles/pathogens

---

### Changes Down the Respiratory Tree

**Trachea:**

- Respiratory epithelium
- C-shaped cartilage (can ossify with age)
- Trachealis muscle posteriorly

**Bronchi:**

- Respiratory epithelium
- Complete cartilage rings
- Smooth muscle
- Glands present

**Bronchioles:**

- **Still respiratory epithelium**
- **Smooth muscle** (important for asthma!)
- **NO cartilage**
- **NO glands**

**Terminal Bronchioles:**

- **Club cells** (formerly Clara cells) appear
    - Non-ciliated, cuboidal
    - Produce protective secretions
    - Some detoxification function
- Sparse smooth muscle
- Surrounded by alveoli

**Respiratory Bronchioles & Alveoli:**

- **Type I pneumocytes**:
    - Thin, flat cells
    - Cover ~95% of alveolar surface
    - **Gas exchange occurs here**
- **Type II pneumocytes** (Septal cells):
    - Cuboidal cells
    - Cover ~5% of surface
    - **Produce surfactant** - reduces surface tension, prevents alveolar collapse
    - Can differentiate into Type I cells (repair)

**Important**: All structures contain **abundant elastin fibers** - provides elastic recoil for passive expiration

---

## The Lungs

### Basic Anatomy

**Two lungs**: Right and left

**Surfaces:**

- **Costal surface**: Against ribs
- **Mediastinal surface**: Faces mediastinum (middle compartment)
- **Diaphragmatic surface**: Rests on diaphragm (base)

**Connection:**

- Via **hilum** (root of lung)
- Contains structures entering/leaving lung

**Covering:**

- **Visceral pleura** directly covers lung surface

---

### Lobes and Fissures

**Right Lung (3 lobes):**

- Superior lobe
- Middle lobe
- Inferior lobe
- Separated by:
    - **Horizontal fissure** (between superior and middle)
    - **Oblique fissure** (between middle and inferior)

**Left Lung (2 lobes):**

- Superior lobe (has **lingula** - tongue-like projection, equivalent to right middle lobe)
- Inferior lobe
- Separated by:
    - **Oblique fissure**

**Why the difference?**

- Left lung smaller to accommodate the heart (cardiac notch)

---

### Bronchopulmonary Segments

**Definition**: Anatomical and functional units of the lung

**Numbers**: **10 per lung** (both sides)

**Key features:**

- Each supplied by **tertiary (segmental) bronchus**
- Each has own blood supply
- Separated by connective tissue septa

**Clinical relevance:**

- **Surgical units**: Can remove diseased segment without affecting others
- Infections can be localized to segments
- **Be aware but don't memorize all segment names for first year**

---

## The Pleura

### Two Layers

**Visceral Pleura:**

- Directly covers lung surface
- Follows into fissures
- Cannot be separated from lung

**Parietal Pleura:**

- Lines thoracic cavity
- Named by location:
    - **Costal pleura**: Lines ribs
    - **Mediastinal pleura**: Covers mediastinum
    - **Diaphragmatic pleura**: Covers diaphragm
    - **Cervical pleura (cupula)**: Extends above 1st rib into neck

---

### Pleural Cavity

**Definition**: Potential space between visceral and parietal pleura

**Contents:**

- **Small amount of serous pleural fluid** (~10-20 mL)

**Functions of pleural fluid:**

- Reduces friction during breathing
- Creates surface tension → helps lungs follow chest wall movement
- Allows smooth gliding of pleural surfaces

**Clinical point**: Normally just a thin film - becomes actual space only in disease (pneumothorax, pleural effusion)

---

## Root of the Lung (Hilum Structures)

### Structures Passing Through (LEARN THESE!)

**5 main structures:**

1. **Main (primary) bronchus**
    - Function: Transport air to/from lungs
2. **Pulmonary artery**
    - Function: Brings **deoxygenated blood** from right ventricle to lung
    - Remember: Only artery in body carrying deoxygenated blood!
3. **Pulmonary veins** (usually 2 per lung)
    - Function: Return **oxygenated blood** to left atrium
    - Remember: Only veins carrying oxygenated blood!
4. **Bronchial arteries** (1 right, 2 left)
    - Function: Supply oxygenated blood to **structural tissues** of lung (bronchi, pleura, etc.)
    - From systemic circulation (descending aorta)
5. **Lymph nodes and vessels**
    - Function: Drain lymph, immune surveillance, filter particles

**Additional structures:**

- Autonomic nerves (sympathetic and parasympathetic)
- Bronchopulmonary lymph nodes

**Arrangement (from superior to inferior at hilum):**

- **Pulmonary artery** (highest)
- **Main bronchus** (posterior)
- **Pulmonary veins** (lowest and most anterior)

**Memory aid**: "**APBV**" from superior to inferior = Artery, bronchus, Veins (though varies slightly between left and right)

---

## Mechanics of Breathing

### Inspiration (Active at Rest)

**Primary muscle:**

- **Diaphragm** - does most of the work at rest
- Contracts → flattens (moves downward)
- Increases vertical dimension of thoracic cavity

**Secondary muscles:**

- **External intercostal muscles** - contribute at rest
- Lift ribs upward and outward
- Increase anteroposterior and lateral dimensions

**Result:**

- Increased thoracic volume
- Intrapleural pressure becomes more negative
- Lungs expand
- Air drawn in (pressure gradient)

---

### Expiration (Passive at Rest)

**At rest:**

- **Passive process** - no muscle contraction needed
- **Elastic recoil** of lungs and chest wall
- Diaphragm relaxes → moves upward
- Thoracic volume decreases
- Air expelled

**With increased demand (exercise, forced expiration):**

- **Active process** - uses accessory muscles:
    - **Internal intercostal muscles**: Pull ribs downward
    - **Abdominal muscles**: Push diaphragm upward

---

### Role of Pleura

- Smooth pleural surfaces with fluid film allow **frictionless movement**
- Surface tension keeps visceral and parietal pleura together
- Ensures lungs follow chest wall movements

---

## Clinical Considerations (Important!)

### 1. Asthma

**Epidemiology:**

- **Commonest lung condition**
- > 8 million people in UK
    
- Can affect any age

**Pathophysiology:**

- **Inflammation of airways**
- **Bronchoconstriction** (smooth muscle contraction)
- Reduced airway diameter → difficulty breathing
- **Reversible** (unlike COPD)

**Types:**

- Allergic (atopic)
- Non-allergic
- Occupational

**Symptoms:**

- Wheezing
- Shortness of breath
- Chest tightness
- Cough (especially at night)

**Treatment hierarchy:**

- **Salbutamol** (reliever): β2-adrenoreceptor agonist
    - Relaxes bronchial smooth muscle
    - Rapid onset (rescue inhaler)
- Inhaled corticosteroids (preventer)
- Long-acting β2 agonists
- Additional therapies as needed

**Key point**: Bronchioles have smooth muscle but no cartilage - this is what contracts in asthma

---

### 2. COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease)

**Definition**: Progressive, irreversible airflow limitation

**Risk factors:**

- **Smoking** - biggest risk factor (85-90% of cases)
- Occupational exposures
- Air pollution
- Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (genetic, rare)

**Two main types:**

**Chronic Bronchitis:**

- **"Blue bloater"**
- Mucus hypersecretion
- Productive cough
- Defined clinically: Cough productive of sputum for ≥3 months in 2 consecutive years

**Emphysema:**

- **"Pink puffer"**
- Alveolar destruction
- Loss of elastic recoil
- Enlarged air spaces
- Reduced surface area for gas exchange

**Key difference from asthma:**

- **Irreversible** airflow obstruction
- Progressive deterioration
- Less responsive to bronchodilators

---

### 3. Lung Cancer

**Types:**

**Primary:**

- **Bronchial carcinoma** (95% of primary lung tumours)
    - Small cell lung cancer (SCLC)
    - Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC): Adenocarcinoma, squamous cell, large cell
- **Mesothelioma** - affects pleura, linked to **asbestos exposure**

**Risk factors:**

- **Smoking** - biggest risk factor (85-90% of cases)
- Occupational exposures (asbestos, radon, arsenic)
- Air pollution
- Family history

**Prognosis:**

- Often **very poor** (late presentation)
- 5-year survival rate low

**Metastases:**

- Lung is common site for **metastatic tumour** from other primaries
- Rich blood supply + large capillary bed = filter for circulating cancer cells
- **Lymphatic spread** common

---

### 4. Foreign Body Aspiration

**Key anatomical fact:**

- Objects tend to enter **RIGHT main bronchus**
- **Why?** Right main bronchus is:
    - **Wider**
    - **Shorter**
    - **More vertical** (straighter continuation of trachea)

**Clinical points:**

- Not all foreign bodies visible on X-ray (only radio-opaque objects)
- **Bronchoscopy** used to visualize and retrieve
- Children most at risk

**Symptoms:**

- Sudden choking
- Coughing
- Wheezing
- Unilateral decreased breath sounds

---

### 5. Pneumothorax

**Definition**: Air in pleural cavity

**Result**: "Collapsed lung"

- Air breaks seal between pleurae
- Lung cannot follow chest wall
- Collapses inward due to elastic recoil

**Types:**

**Spontaneous:**

- **Primary**: No underlying lung disease
    - Classic patient: **Tall, thin, young male**
    - Rupture of apical bleb
- **Secondary**: Underlying lung disease (COPD, asthma, CF)

**Traumatic:**

- Penetrating chest injury (stab, gunshot)
- Rib fracture puncturing lung
- Iatrogenic (medical procedure - central line, lung biopsy)

**Tension pneumothorax:**

- One-way valve effect
- Air enters but can't escape
- Increasing pressure
- **Medical emergency** - can be fatal
- Pushes mediastinum to opposite side
- Compresses heart and great vessels

**Treatment:**

- Small: Observation (may reabsorb)
- Large: Chest drain (chest tube)
- Tension: **Immediate needle decompression**

**X-ray findings:**

- Visible lung edge
- Absent lung markings peripherally
- Dark (black) area where air is

---

### 6. Pneumonia

**Definition**: Infection of lung parenchyma (alveoli)

**Types:**

**By pathogen:**

- **Bacterial**: Most common (_Streptococcus pneumoniae_, _Haemophilus influenzae_, _Staphylococcus aureus_)
- **Viral**: Influenza, RSV, COVID-19
- **Fungal**: _Pneumocystis jirovecii_ (in immunocompromised)
- **Atypical**: _Mycoplasma_, _Legionella_

**By distribution:**

- **Lobar pneumonia**: Affects entire lobe
- **Bronchopneumonia**: Patchy, affects multiple areas

**Risk factors:**

- **Lying supine** - aspiration risk
- Elderly
- Underlying health conditions (COPD, heart failure, diabetes)
- Immunocompromised
- Smoking

**Symptoms:**

- Fever, cough (productive), dyspnea
- Pleuritic chest pain
- Systemic symptoms

---

### 7. Cystic Fibrosis (CF)

**Genetics:**

- **Autosomal recessive**
- **1 in 2,000** births (UK)
- **Commonest genetic disease** in Caucasian populations
- **CFTR gene mutation** (Chromosome 7)

**Pathophysiology:**

- **Malfunctioning chloride transporter** (CFTR protein)
- Abnormal ionic composition of secretions
- **Mucus too thick and sticky**

**Respiratory effects:**

- Thick mucus blocks airways
- **Impaired mucociliary clearance**
- Chronic infections (especially _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_)
- **Bronchiectasis** (permanent airway dilation)
- Progressive lung damage
- Respiratory failure (main cause of death)

**Other effects:**

- Pancreatic insufficiency (malabsorption)
- Infertility (males)
- Liver disease

**Treatment:**

- Chest physiotherapy
- Mucolytics
- Antibiotics (chronic prophylaxis)
- CFTR modulators (newer drugs)
- Lung transplant (severe cases)
