## 🔥 **Acute Inflammation – Overview**

**Definition:**  
A rapid, short-term (minutes to days) response to tissue injury or infection, designed to eliminate the cause and start repair.

Think of it as the body’s **“emergency response team”** — quick to arrive, dramatic, and powerful, but not meant to stay long.

---

## 🦠 **1. Causes of Acute Inflammation**

The body only has a few ways to respond to injury, whatever the trigger.

|Cause Type|Examples|Mechanism/Notes|
|---|---|---|
|**Infective**|Bacterial (pneumonia, abscess), viral, protozoal|Microbes trigger immune cell activation|
|**Allergic/Hypersensitivity**|Eczema, drug rash|Immune system overreacts to harmless substances|
|**Physical**|UV light (sunburn), trauma, foreign body|Direct cell damage|
|**Chemical**|Strong acids or alkalis|Tissue necrosis due to corrosive injury|

⛑ **Remember:** “Acute” = sudden onset, short duration (minutes to days).

## 🔴 **2. Physical Characteristics (“Cardinal Signs” by Celsus, ~25 BCE)**

These are _classic signs of inflammation_:

1. **Rubor** – redness (from vasodilation)
    
2. **Calor** – heat (from increased blood flow)
    
3. **Tumor** – swelling (from fluid exudation)
    
4. **Dolor** – pain (from bradykinin, prostaglandins)
    
5. **Functio laesa** – loss of function (due to pain and swelling)
    

🧠 _Analogy:_ Think of an inflamed area as a “busy construction site” — red lights (rubor), warmth from machinery (calor), swelling from debris (tumor), and pain if you step on it (dolor).

---

## 💉 **3. Vascular Phase**

**Goal:** Get more blood and immune cells to the injured area.

**Sequence:**

1. **Brief vasoconstriction** – momentary reflex.
    
2. **Vasodilation** – arterioles widen → ↑ blood flow → redness and heat.
    
3. **Increased vascular permeability** – endothelial cells contract → gaps open → plasma, proteins, and cells escape into tissues.
    

🩸 _Analogy:_ Imagine opening a garden hose tap — more water (blood) flows, and tiny leaks appear (endothelial gaps).

---

## 💧 **4. Exudative Phase**

**Fluid and cells move into the tissue** through those leaky capillaries.

|Term|Description|Key Composition|
|---|---|---|
|**Exudate**|Active leakage due to inflammation|Protein-rich (fibrin, antibodies) + cells|
|**Transudate**|Passive fluid movement from pressure changes (non-inflammatory)|Mostly water and electrolytes|

💡 _Tip:_ Exudate = “extra stuff” (protein + cells). Transudate = “thin” fluid.

## 🔬 **5. Key Cells and Mediators**

### 🧫 **Macrophages**

- Activated by tissue damage.
    
- Release:
    
    - **Chemokines, IL-1** → attract neutrophils and make endothelium sticky.
        
    - **TNF (Tumour Necrosis Factor)** → increases vascular permeability.
        
- Later, they clean up debris and dead cells (“garbage collectors”).
    

### ⚪ **Neutrophils**

- **First responders** (arrive within hours).
    
- Recognise bacteria via:
    
    - **Formylmethionine** (bacterial surface marker)
        
    - **Antibody/complement coating (C3b)**
        
- Kill via:
    
    - **Lysozyme** (breaks bacterial walls)
        
    - **Hydrogen peroxide (oxidative burst)**
        
- **Short-lived (8–12 h)** → apoptosis → need constant replenishment.
    

🧠 _Analogy:_ Neutrophils are like firefighters — arrive fast, cause collateral damage, then leave.

### 🧩 **Mast Cells & Basophils**

- Activated by:
    
    - Tissue damage
        
    - Complement (C3a, C5a)
        
    - IgE binding (in allergies)
        
- Release:
    
    - **Histamine** → vasodilation, permeability
        
    - **Leukotrienes** → attract other WBCs
        
    - **Prostaglandins** → pain and vasodilation
        

📍 _Mnemonic:_ _HLP_ = Histamine, Leukotrienes, Prostaglandins.

## 🧬 **6. Plasma Mediators**

|System|Main Effect|
|---|---|
|**Coagulation**|Fibrin forms a “mesh” to wall off infection|
|**Complement**|Attracts phagocytes, opsonises bacteria|
|**Bradykinin**|Causes vasodilation, pain sensitivity|

---

## 👁 **7. Recognising Acute Inflammation**

### **Macroscopic (Gross) Appearance**

- Varies by site:
    
    - Skin → redness, swelling, pus
        
    - Lung → consolidation (pneumonia)
        
    - Appendix → swollen, purulent
        
    - Brain → abscess surrounded by oedema
        

**Terminology:**

|Term|Meaning|
|---|---|
|**Abscess**|Localised pus walled off by fibrin/connective tissue|
|**Pus**|Neutrophils + dead cells + bacteria|
|**Empyema**|Pus in an existing cavity (pleura, gallbladder, etc.)|

### **Microscopic Appearance**

- Normal tissue vs. inflamed tissue shows:
    
    - Neutrophil infiltration
        
    - Dilated vessels
        
    - Fibrin and exudate

## 🧫 **8. Subtypes of Acute Inflammation**

|Type|Example|Key Feature|
|---|---|---|
|**Serous**|Blister (burn)|Watery fluid|
|**Fibrinous**|Pleura, pericardium|Fibrin-rich exudate|
|**Purulent (Suppurative)**|Abscess|Pus (neutrophils + debris)|
|**Haemorrhagic**|Meningococcal infection|RBCs in exudate|
|**Catarrhal**|Sinusitis|Mucus + neutrophils|
|**Membranous**|Glomerulonephritis|Membrane formation|

🧠 _Analogy:_ Each subtype is like a “flavour” of inflammation depending on tissue and severity.

## 💪 **9. Outcomes of Acute Inflammation**

1. **Resolution** – complete recovery (ideal)
    
2. **Abscess formation**
    
3. **Chronic inflammation** – if cause persists
    
4. **Fibrosis/scarring**

## 🌟 **10. Beneficial vs Harmful Effects**

|**Beneficial**|**Harmful**|
|---|---|
|Dilutes toxins|Tissue destruction|
|Brings antibodies, antibiotics|Swelling in confined spaces (e.g. brain)|
|Fibrin “walls off” infection|Systemic sepsis|
|Antigens carried to lymph nodes → antibody production|“Cytokine storm” (excessive immune activation)|

---

## 🌡 **11. Systemic Effects of Acute Inflammation**

|Mediator|Effect|
|---|---|
|**TNF, IL-1 (from macrophages)**|Fever (reset hypothalamic thermostat)|
|**G-CSF**|↑ neutrophil production in marrow|
|**CRP (C-reactive protein)**|Binds microbes, enhances complement|
|**↑ Immunoglobulins**|Help with opsonisation|

🧠 _Clinical pearl:_ CRP is often used in blood tests as a marker of inflammation severity.

Answering the questions directly

### **1️⃣ Principal Causes of Acute Inflammation**

Acute inflammation is the **body’s immediate response** to injury — no matter what caused it.  
Think of it as the body’s “fire alarm” going off to call in emergency services.

**Main causes:**

|Category|Example|Mechanism|
|---|---|---|
|**Infective**|Bacterial pneumonia, abscess, viral hepatitis|Microbial toxins and antigens trigger immune cells|
|**Allergic / Hypersensitivity**|Eczema, drug rash|Immune system overreacts to harmless antigens|
|**Physical**|Sunburn (UV light), trauma, foreign body|Direct cell damage causes release of inflammatory mediators|
|**Chemical**|Acid or alkali burns|Corrosive tissue injury|

🧠 **Remember:** _Inflammation doesn’t care about the cause — the tissue reaction looks very similar whether it’s infection, trauma, or acid._

---

### **2️⃣ Physical Characteristics (“Cardinal Signs”)**

First described by **Celsus (25 BCE–50 CE)** — and they’re still relevant today.

|Latin term|English|Why it happens|
|---|---|---|
|**Rubor**|Redness|Arteriolar vasodilation → ↑ blood flow|
|**Calor**|Heat|Warm blood + increased metabolism|
|**Tumor**|Swelling|Fluid (exudate) leaks into tissues|
|**Dolor**|Pain|Bradykinin and prostaglandins irritate nerve endings|
|**Functio laesa**|Loss of function|Pain and swelling restrict movement|

💡 _Analogy:_ Imagine a construction site — red warning lights (rubor), heat from machinery (calor), piles of debris (tumor), and the area is tender and out of action (dolor + functio laesa).

---

### **3️⃣ Vascular and Exudative Phases**

These two phases explain _how inflammation looks and behaves._

#### **Vascular Phase**

- **Goal:** Increase blood flow and vessel permeability.
    
- **Steps:**
    
    1. **Brief arteriolar constriction** (seconds)
        
    2. **Arteriolar dilation** → more blood → redness + heat
        
    3. **Endothelial cells contract** → gaps open → plasma proteins and cells can leave circulation
        

🧠 _Analogy:_ Like turning up the pressure in a garden hose and loosening its joints — more flow, but also some leakage.

#### **Exudative Phase**

- **Goal:** Bring defensive proteins and white cells to the site.
    
- **Process:**
    
    - **Exudate formation:** protein- and cell-rich fluid leaks out.
        
    - **Cell migration:** neutrophils squeeze through vessel walls (diapedesis) toward injury.
        
- **Key cell players:**
    
    - **Neutrophils:** first on scene; phagocytose bacteria; short-lived.
        
    - **Macrophages:** clean up debris, release cytokines (IL-1, TNF).
        
    - **Mast cells/basophils:** release histamine, prostaglandins, leukotrienes → vasodilation, permeability, pain.
        

|Term|Description|Contents|
|---|---|---|
|**Exudate**|Inflammatory fluid from leaky vessels|Proteins + immune cells|
|**Transudate**|Fluid from pressure imbalance (non-inflammatory)|Mostly water + ions|

---

### **4️⃣ Macroscopic and Microscopic Appearance**

#### **Macroscopic (Gross)**

Appearance varies by organ, but general features:

- Red, swollen, hot, painful tissue.
    
- **Pus formation** common (neutrophils + debris + bacteria).
    

**Key terms:**

|Term|Meaning|Example|
|---|---|---|
|**Abscess**|Localised collection of pus|Skin abscess|
|**Empyema**|Pus in an existing body cavity|Pleural empyema|
|**Pus**|Neutrophils + dead tissue + bacteria|Any suppurative infection|

**Subtypes:**

|Type|Example|Key Feature|
|---|---|---|
|**Serous**|Burn blister|Clear, watery fluid|
|**Fibrinous**|Pericarditis|Fibrin mesh|
|**Purulent**|Abscess|Thick pus|
|**Haemorrhagic**|Meningococcal infection|RBCs present|
|**Catarrhal**|Sinusitis|Mucus-rich|
|**Membranous**|Glomerulonephritis|Membrane formation|

#### **Microscopic**

Under the microscope:

- Dilated capillaries (hyperaemia)
    
- Leaky vessels with fibrin and protein in tissue
    
- **Neutrophil infiltration** (hallmark)
    
- Dead cells and debris
    
- Later: macrophages cleaning up
    

🧠 _Analogy:_ Think of a battlefield: the blood supply increases (reinforcements arrive), neutrophils are the soldiers, macrophages clean up afterward.

### **5️⃣ Beneficial, Harmful, and Systemic Effects**

#### **Beneficial Effects**

1. **Dilution of toxins** — reduces local concentration.
    
2. **Delivery of antibodies and immune cells** — helps neutralise microbes.
    
3. **Fibrin mesh formation** — walls off infection to limit spread.
    
4. **Transport of antigens to lymph nodes** — stimulates adaptive immunity.
    

#### **Harmful Effects**

1. **Destruction of normal tissue** — collateral damage (e.g., abscess or fistula formation).
    
2. **Swelling in confined spaces** — e.g., brain → raised ICP, nerve compression.
    
3. **Sepsis / Cytokine storm** — excessive cytokine release (IL-1, TNF) causes systemic vasodilation, hypotension, and multi-organ dysfunction.
    

#### **Systemic Effects**

|Mediator|Effect|
|---|---|
|**IL-1, TNF**|Fever (reset hypothalamic thermostat)|
|**G-CSF**|Stimulates bone marrow to release more neutrophils|
|**CRP (C-reactive protein)**|Acute phase protein, opsonises microbes|
|**↑ Immunoglobulins**|Enhances immune defence|

🧠 _Clinical pearl:_ CRP and fever are both reflections of systemic cytokine activity — they tell you inflammation is happening _somewhere._

### ✅ **In summary**

Acute inflammation is a **rapid, protective response** that:

- Starts with **vascular changes** (dilation + leak),
    
- Is dominated by **neutrophil infiltration**, and
    
- Aims to **remove the cause and start repair**,  
    but can cause harm if it’s **uncontrolled or excessive.**
