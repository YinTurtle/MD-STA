### *Types of carbohydrates*

**Monosaccharides**
- simplest carbohydrates

**Dissaccharides**
- consist of two monosaccharides

**Polysaccharides**
- contains many monosaccharides

![[Types of carbohydrates.png]]


### *Monosaccharides*

- consist of 3-6 carbon atoms typically
- a carbonyl group (aldehyde or ketone)
- several hydroxyl groups
- all monosaccharides whether an aldose or a ketose are reducing sugars

##### *Aldoses*
are monosaccharides
- with an aldehyde group
- with many  hydroxyl (-OH) groups
	- triose (3C atoms)
	- tetrose (4C atoms)
	- pentose (5C atoms)
	- hexose (6C atoms)
![[Aldose Example.png]]

##### *Ketoses*
are monosaccharides
- with a ketone group
- with many hydroxyl (-OH) groups
![[Ketose Example.png]]

## *Chirality*

Hands

Property of an object that is not identical to its mirror image and cannot be superimposed onto it

#### *Fischer projection*
- used to represent carbohydrates
- places the most oxidized group at the top
- shows chiral carbons as the intersection of vertical and horizontal lines

**L and D notations**
- In a Fischer projection, the -OH group on the chiral carbon farthest from the carbonyl group determines and L or D isomer
- left is L
- right is D

### *D-glucose*

- Found in fruits and honey
- An aldohexose with the formula C$_6$H$_{12}$O$_6$
- Known as blood sugar in the body
- The monosaccharide in the polymers of starch, cellulose, and glycogen

##### *D-galactose*
- Body cannot digest galactose
- Must be converted to glucose first to digest
![[D-Galactose Structural.png]]

##### *Galactosemia*
- lack of enzyme(s) required for galactose metabolism
- can result in accumulation of galactose intermediates
- toxic effects in liver, brain, kidneys and eyes

### *Cyclic Structure*

Down for $\alpha$
Up for the $\beta$

---

### *Lactose*

- is a disaccharide of $\beta$-D-galactose and $\alpha$- or $\beta$-D-glucose
- contains a $\beta$-1,4-glycosidic bond
- is found in milk and milk products

##### *Lactose intolerance*
unable to digest lactose

---

### *Polysaccharides*

- The most common homopolymer in animal cells is glycogen
- Glycogen is the storage form of glucose.
- Predominantly found in liver and muscle
- Glycogen is a highly branched polysaccharide made of multiple glucose units linked by $\alpha$-1,4 and $\alpha$-1,6-glycosidic bonds.

### *Starch*
- Starch is the plant form of carbohydrate ingested by humans
- Amylose is an unbranched starch comprised of glucose units ($\alpha$-1,4 linkage)
- Amylopectin is the branched form with $\alpha$-amylase secreted by salivary glands and the pancreas hydrolyzes amylose and amylopectin

### *Cellulose*
- Storage in plants
- $\beta$-1,4 linkage
- Each glucose inverted of neighbour
- Mammals lack cellulases - roughage

##### *Sugars are an integral part of nucleotides*
- Nitrogen ring linked to a five carbon sugar
- Sugar can be ribose or deoxyribose
- Phosphate groups attached

### *Summary*
- Carbohydrates may be simple or complex
- Important sources of energy
- Modification of lipids and proteins
- Component of DNA and RNA
- Implications for health and disease
