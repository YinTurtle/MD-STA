## *Common medical imaging types*

**Radiograph (X-ray)**
Uses electromagnetic radiation to quickly produce images of the body, primarily showing dense structures like bones.

Common uses: Diagnosing bone fractures, arthritis, dental issues, chest infections (like pneumonia), bone tumors, and detecting foreign objects.

Clinical example: A patient with a suspected broken arm receives an X-ray to diagnose the fracture.


**Computed tomography (CT)** 
Uses a series of X-ray images taken from multiple angles and using computer processing to create a detailed cross-sectional views of the internal body structure.

Common uses: Evaluating trauma (e.g. internal bleeding or complex fractures), cancer detection and staging, vascular disease, heart or lung disease, and guiding biopsies.

Clinical example: After a car accident, a patient with suspected internal injuries undergoes a CT scan for rapid assessment of bleeding and organ damage.


**Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)**
Utilizes strong magnetic fields and radio waves to generate highly detailed images of soft tissues, organs, and the nervous system, without exposure to ionizing radiation.

Common uses: Diagnosing brain tumors, spinal cord injuries, joint and ligament damage, neurological disorders (like multiple sclerosis), and certain heart or abdominal conditions.

Clinical example: Torn ligaments or cartilage, brain scan etc


**Ultrasound**
Uses high-frequency sound waves to produce real-time images, primarily of soft tissues, organs, and blood flow; does not involve radiation.

Common uses and clinical example: Pregnancy

## *Skin*

**Integumentary system**
- Largest Organ and the heaviest
- Composed of epidermis, dermis and subcutaneous tissue (hypodermis)

![[Skin Diagram.png]]

**Epidermis**
- Keratinised epithelium
- Some nerve endings
- Avascular ( no blood vessels)
- Shedding (2 grams per day) and regeneration
- Basal layer constantly replicates, migrating to the surface, developing more keratin, hence causing shedding.

**Dermis**
- Collagenous and elastin rich
- i.e. tough and stretchy
- Vascular and innervated
- Contains hair follicles, arrector pili muscles (small, involuntary muscle that attach hair follicle in the dermis, causing "goosebumps" or "piloerection"), 
- Contains sweat gland (eccrine and apocrine)

**Subcutaneous tissue (hypodermis)**
- Adipose tissue (fat) store
- Vascular and innervated

### *Sweat Glands

The skin contains sweat glands: eccrine and apocrine

**Eccrine**
Water and some electrolytes, present on almost all skin
- this helps with thermoregulation

**Apocrine**
Lipid/protein rich secretion, select sites (axillae, perineal area, genital area) - "activate" with puberty


### *Functions*

Protection - keratin, collagen, elastin
Containment - capable of expanding and contraction
Thermoregulation - sweat, hair and arrector pili superficial vasculature
Sensory - nerve endings - pain, temperature, proprioception (body's sense of movement, action and location), fine touch
Vitamin D synthesis vs. protection from UV - melanin content
Can absorb medications (more readily in lipid-based preparation)


### *Langer's Lines*

- Specific lines of tension within the skin
- Conferred by the main orientation of collagen fibres
- Implications for surgical incisions

- Collagens pull apart if against the line
- Specific lines of tension within the skin

![[Langer's Lines.png]]

## *Axial and appendicular skeleton*

Skeleton = bones and cartilage

**Axial**
Skull, vertebrae, sacrum, ribs, coccyx, hyoid, sternum
- To protect the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and vital organs in the chest. It also provides a stable framework for the head, neck, and trunk and is involved in respiratory movements. 

**Appendicular**
Limbs, clavicle and scapula, hip bones
- To provide support for body weight, allow for locomotion (walking, running), and enable grasping and manipulating objects.


![[Axial and Appendicular skeleton.png]]


---

## *Nervous System*

- Senses and responds to external and internal stimuli
- The nervous system is subdivided on the basis of structure and function

- CNS = central nervous system
- PNS = peripheral nervous system

![[Nervous System Flow Chart.png]]

- Neurones are the functional cells of the nervous system
- They conduct small electrical signals based on charge differences across their membranes
- Neurones are actually outnumbered by cells called glial cells which support them

![[Effector and Receptor Organs.png]]

![[Microdiagram of Neurones.png]]

- Neurones communicate via neurotransmitter release at synapses
- A collection of cell bodies is termed a ganglion (singular: ganglia)
- Ganglia are sites of synapsing

![[Ganglia Diagram.png]]


### *CNS - brain and spinal cord*

- Covered in protective layers of meninges
	- Dura mater - tough outer layer
	- Arachnoid mater - middle layer, creates a subarachnoid space for cerebrospinal fluid
	- Pia mater - closely adhered (attached) to brain/spinal cord


### *Peripheral NS*

- 31 paired spinal nerves, 8 cervical, 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, 5 sacral, 1 coccygeal (can be supernumerary coccygeal nerves)
- Abbreviated to C/T/L/S and segment number
- Spinal nerves serve dermatomes (sensory) and myotomes (motor)

![[PNS Spinal Diagram.png]]

![[Anterior and Posterior PNS Spinal Diagram.png]]

- 12 paired cranial nerves
- Arise from brain/brainstem
- Functions mostly occur in head and neck, with exception of vagus nerve (CNX)
- “Special” senses (sight, smell, taste, hearing, balance)

![[Under Brain Diagram.png]]

### *Autonomic Nervous System*

-  Autonomic = self governing
- Sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions

#### *Sympathetic*
"fight or flight"

- Dilates pupils, increases cardiac output, dilates bronchioles, increase blood to muscle, slow digestion etc.
- Cell bodies in intermediolateral columns of spinal cord (Thoracolumbar, T1 - L3)

![[ANS Sympathetic Diagram.png]]

#### *Parasympathetic*
"rest & digest"

- Constrict pupil, decrease cardiac output, promote digestive functions etc.
- Cell bodies in brainstem and sacral segments S2-4 (Craniosacral)

![[ANS Parasympathetic Diagram.png]]

- Oral, Orbital, Nasal/Sinus, Middle Ear, Synovial

#### *Dorsal Body Cavity*
2 main parts
- Covered by 3 protective membranes called the meninges
	- Dura mater, arachnoid mater, and pia mater
		- *Meningitis is an inflammation of the meninges*

**Cranial Cavity**

**Vertebral Cavity**
- houses the spinal cord


#### *Ventral Body Cavity*
Contains visceral organs (guts)

P.S. Ventral contains Viscera (guts)

Contains various serous membranes (filled with watery substance called serous fluid that lubes organs)
	- Pleura
		membrane that lines the pleural cavity, which covers the lungs in the thoracic cavity
	- Pericardium
		membrane that lines the pericardial cavity, which covers the heart in the mediastinum (the middle part of the thoracic cavity)
	- Peritoneum
		membrane that lines the peritoneal cavity and covers the organs that fill the abdominopelvic cavity

![[Heart Cavity.png]]

Membranes lining
- Visceral Lining of membrane touches organ
	- Viscera = Organs
- Parietal Lining of membrane lines cavity wall
	- Parietal = wall
- In between
	- Pleural Cavity

![[Lung Cavity.png]]

2 main parts
Separated by the diaphragm

**Thoracic Cavity (also called as chest cavity)**
- Superior to the abdominopelvic cavity
- 3 main portions
	- Left Pleural Cavity
		- houses left lung
	- Mediastinum
		- Contains pericardial cavity (heart), trachea, oesophagus, thymus gland
			- The heart itself is located in its own cavity (pericardial cavity - peri means around, cardi means heart) 
	- Right Pleural Cavity
		- houses right lung


**Abdominopelvic Cavity**
- 2 main cavity (Abdominal and Pelvic)
	- Abdominal Cavity

## *Embryology*

All humans start as two cells that form a zygote

- Implantation of blastocyst into uterus occurs by days 7-9
- Two layers of cells form from the inner cell mass - epiblast and hypoblast
![[Embryology Start.png]]

Start with a single cell zygote, that divides roughly 30 hours after fertilisation.
- After dividing, the packed cells are called Morula
- As these cells keep dividing, they eventually run out of room to get nutrient from the surface
	- This then form a cavity called a Blastocyst Cavity
	- At this point, instead of it being called Morula, it becomes a Blastocyst
- The cells keeps dividing, and the Blastocyst gets larger and larger
	- One group of cells eventually gets sequestered (secluded) to one end of the blastocyst
		- Outer Cell Mass form the periphery
			- These later form the placenta etc
		- The grouping of the cells is called the Inner Cell Mass (still surrounded by the Outer Cell Mass)
			- Cells later becomes "longer", called Epiblast
				- Will eventually form the embryos
			- Cells that are in contact with the Blastocyst Cavity are called Hypoblast
				- Despite being part of the Inner Cell Mass, does not contribute anything to the maturity of the human being
	- The Blastocyst Cavity "changes its name" to Primary Yolk Sac
		-  The tall epiblast cells form another cavity - called Amnion
			- will eventually surround and completely encompass the developing foetus till birth
	![[Implantation of Blastocyst.png]]
- Gastrulation occurs (day 17)
	- imagine you slice the head open the amniotic cavity
	- Bilaminar Embryo
		- Group name for the epiblast cells, hypoblast cells, and the amniotic cavity (that was sliced open)
		- When viewed cross-sectionally, looks like an elongated disc of epiblast cells
			- These cells eventually form all the structure of the developing human
		- Primitive streak appears
			- The tip is called the Primitive Pit
			- Signalling area appears called the Primitive Node
				- This is where gastrulation occurs
		- The cells in the streak are still actively folding under (dividing), invading under the primitive pit, to fill in the space in between the space beneath the epiblast and above the hypoblast. In this process, the hypoblast cell is distinguished
			- As they roll under, they form 2 new layers - endoderm, mesoderm
			- Once the process is complete, epiblast layer above is called the ectoderm
				- Layer goes as follows:
					- Ectoderm
					- Mesoderm
					- Endoderm
				- They all come from the epiblast
		- A group of cells on the midline of the epiblast that rolled under the primitive node and on the midline of the epiblast will form a signalling structure, that is called the notochord
			- Basically a tube of cells sitting under the epiblast, and is the structure that signals the formation of more important structures later that forms tissues
	![[Gastrulation.png]]
- Neurulation from Trilaminar Embryo Stage
	- Ectoderm, Mesoderm, Endoderm
		- All controlled by the signals that comes from the notochord
		- First major signals from the notochord is an involution of the ectoderm to form the Neural Tube
			- The neural tube will form all of the central nervous system
		- Ectoderm thickens and forms a fold on the midline: forming a Neural Groove and Folds on either side. These folds continue to approach one another until they 'zip' together, leaving a small area 'invading' the mesoderm.
			- The neural tube fully dissociates from the rest of the ectoderm, and the rest of the ectoderm seals itself back up together, forming the Epidermis.
	- Overall becoming subdivided. After neurulation, the neural tube itself has signalled the mesoderm to further differentiate into different structures.
		- The area surrounding the neural tube, somatic mesoderm, is going to form somites.
			- Itself is surrounded by intermediate mesoderm
				- Will form the gonads and the kidneys (urogenital system)
- Gut Tube
	- Intra embryonic coelom forms a “horseshoe” shape around the developing head 
		- Between the lateral plate mesoderm layers (i.e. visceral and parietal layers)
		![[Embryology D21.png]]
	- Between 2 layers of the lateral plate mesoderm, spaces developed called Intraembryonic Coelom (or cavities), until they separate the lateral plate mesoderm into 2 portions
		- The lower lateral plate mesoderm section that is in contact with the endoderm, the whole assemblage is now referred to as the Visceral/Splanchnic Lateral Plate Mesoderm
			- It will fold in on itself, forming the gut tube, and all the connective tissue and smooth muscle that surrounds the gut tube
		- The upper plate remaining, is called the Somatic/Parietal Lateral Plate Mesoderm
			- It will fold in, and also over the gut tube. During the formation, it will also form a cavity within the body.
				- This cavity is the thoracic cage, the abdominal body wall and most of the pelvis anteriorly (the wall of the Somatic Lateral Plate Mesoderm)
		- Cavity lined by somatic mesoderm, gut tube/mesentery by visceral mesoderm
		![[Folding of Lateral Plate Mesoderm.png]]![[Mesentery Formed D24.png]]![[Embryology Secondary D21.png]]
	D28 onwards
		- The continuous primitive body cavities must then undergo partitioning
		- Lungs buds invaginate into pericardioperitoneal canals forming pleural cavities and pleuropericardial folds (a ridge of mesenchyme = embryonic connective tissue) separate the pericardial and pleural cavities
		- pleuropericardial folds form fibrous pericardium
		![[Embryology D28.png]]
		![[Embryology ~5weeks.png]]
	- The diaphragm forms to separate thoracic and abdominopelvic cavities
	- Composed of septum transversum, pleuroperitoneal membranes, mesentery of oesophagus and the body wall
		![[Embryology Secondary 5weeks.png]]![[Embryology 7weeks.png]]![[Embryology Overall.png]]

#### *SAQ for Embryology*

**Describe the formation of the body cavities starting from implantation (7 marks)**

- The blastocyst implants into the uterus between days 7 and 9, originally composed of two layers – an epiblast and hypoblast.
- Gastrulation occurs (day 17) where the epiblast forms a three layered disc composed of ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm layers.
- The lateral plate mesoderm divides, with intra embryonic coelom forming between a visceral and parietal layer of lateral plate mesoderm
- Lateral folding of the embryo causes the body walls to close around the gut tube, forming a continuous primitive body cavity.
- At the same time, cranio-caudal folding brings the developing heart and septum transversum caudally.
- The primitive body cavity is partitioned by the diaphragm (from the septum transversum and pleuroperitoneal folds) which separates the peritoneal cavity from the pleural cavities and pericardial cavity.
- The lungs buds invaginate into the pericardioperitoneal canals, which are separated from the pericardial cavity by pleuropericardial folds.
