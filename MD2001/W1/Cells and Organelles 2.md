## 📦 The Secretory Pathway: Overview

Cells constantly move material between organelles using **membrane-bound vesicles** — tiny “delivery trucks”.

### 🧭 Topology Principle

- The **lumen of an organelle** (e.g. ER, Golgi) is topologically **equivalent to the cell exterior**.  
    → So a protein inside a vesicle’s lumen will end up **outside the cell** after exocytosis.    

### 🔀 Three main secretory routes

| Pathway          | Description                                     | Example                                     |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Constitutive** | Continuous secretion or membrane recycling      | Collagen secretion, plasma membrane renewal |
| **Regulated**    | Vesicles stored until a signal triggers release | Insulin secretion from β-cells              |
| **Lysosomal**    | Delivers enzymes to lysosomes for digestion     | Mannose-6-phosphate–tagged hydrolases       |

## 🏗️ Vesicle Transport: How Cargo Moves

- Proteins leave one organelle in **coated vesicles** (often clathrin-coated).
    
- Vesicles travel along **microtubule “rail tracks”** pulled by **motor proteins**.
    

### ⚙️ Motor Proteins

|Protein|Direction|Analogy|Function|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Kinesin**|Moves _away_ from cell centre (→ + end)|“Delivery van driver”|Takes cargo from Golgi → plasma membrane|
|**Dynein**|Moves _toward_ cell centre (→ – end)|“Return truck”|Brings cargo back to Golgi or nucleus|

Microtubules act like **one-way motorways** — vesicles “drive” along them between organelles.

---

## 🎯 The Centrosome – The Cell’s Microtubule Organiser

- Acts as the **main hub** where microtubules grow out from.
    
- Located near the nucleus and Golgi.
    
- Contains **centrioles**, which organise spindle fibres during cell division.
    

🧠 **Analogy:** The centrosome is the **“city’s central train station”** — all microtubule tracks radiate from it.

---

## 🧹 Lysosomes – The Cell’s Recycling Centres

- Membrane-bound organelles packed with **≈ 60 hydrolase enzymes** (proteases, lipases, nucleases, etc.).
- Located throughout the cytoplasm - surrounded by the cytosol
	- Formed at the golgi apparatus and the ER
- Work best at **acidic pH (~5)**.
    
- Degrade: worn-out organelles, macromolecules, foreign material.

| Function                        | Description                                                                         | Example                                        |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Digestion of macromolecules** | Breaks down proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids into building blocks | Degrades old mitochondria or ingested bacteria |
| **Autophagy**                   | Removes old or damaged organelles (“self-eating”)                                   | Turnover of worn-out mitochondria (mitophagy)  |
| **Phagocytosis support**        | Fuses with vesicles containing bacteria or debris to digest them                    | Neutrophils and macrophages killing pathogens  |
| **Recycling**                   | Reuses amino acids, sugars, and lipids for new synthesis                            | Nutrient conservation during fasting           |
| **Apoptosis (cell death)**      | Releases enzymes if cell damage is severe                                           | Controlled destruction of defective cells      |

### Formation

1. Enzymes made in RER → modified in Golgi.
    
2. Tagged with **mannose-6-phosphate (M6P)** in Golgi.
    
3. Sent to **late endosomes** → mature into **lysosomes**.
    

### Function

- **Autophagy:** digesting obsolete organelles (e.g. old mitochondria).
    
- **Endocytosis:** breaking down material from outside the cell.
    
- **Recycling:** returning monomers (AA, sugars, lipids) for reuse.

## ⚕️ Clinical Relevance: Lysosomal Storage Diseases

> “When the recycling plant fails, rubbish piles up.”

Mutations in genes for lysosomal enzymes cause **substrate accumulation** inside cells.

|Disease|Defective Enzyme / Gene|Key Features|
|---|---|---|
|**Gaucher disease**|Glucocerebrosidase (GBA gene)|Accumulated glycolipids → hepatosplenomegaly, bone lesions|
|**Tay-Sachs**|β-hexosaminidase A|Accumulated GM2 ganglioside → neurodegeneration|
|**Pompe disease**|Acid maltase|Glycogen buildup in muscle → cardiomegaly|
|**Niemann-Pick**|Sphingomyelinase|Lipid accumulation → liver & brain damage|

🩺 _Gaucher example:_  
Type I = no CNS involvement; Type II = infantile, severe; Type III = intermediate with neurological signs.

## 🧺 Endocytosis – Bringing Material In

Cells internalise material by **invagination of the plasma membrane**.

### Types

|Type|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|**Phagocytosis**|“Cell eating” – uptake of large particles|Macrophages engulfing bacteria|
|**Pinocytosis**|“Cell drinking” – non-specific fluid uptake|Most cells|
|**Receptor-mediated**|Specific uptake via receptors|LDL-cholesterol uptake|

---

### 🧩 Clathrin-Mediated Endocytosis

1. Ligand (e.g. LDL) binds receptor.
    
2. Receptors cluster in **clathrin-coated pits**.
    
3. Pit invaginates; **dynamin (GTPase)** pinches it off.
    
4. Vesicle loses coat → fuses with **early endosome** → either recycled or sent to lysosome.
    

⚕️ **Familial Hypercholesterolaemia (FH):**

- Mutation in the **LDL receptor** → poor uptake of LDL.
    
- Cholesterol accumulates in plasma → premature atherosclerosis, xanthomas.  
    👉 _Key principle:_ A cell biology defect → systemic cardiovascular disease.
    

---

## 🧩 Protein Degradation by the Proteasome

Not all “rubbish” needs a lysosome!

- **Proteasomes** are barrel-shaped enzyme complexes in the **cytosol**.
    
- Degrade **misfolded or damaged proteins** tagged with **ubiquitin**.
    
- No membrane; works via chemical digestion rather than vesicular fusion.
    

🧠 **Analogy:** Think of proteasomes as the **shredders inside the cytoplasm**.

---

### ⚙️ Ubiquitin–Proteasome System (UPS)

**Steps:**

1. **Ubiquitination:** target protein tagged with small ubiquitin proteins (E1–E2–E3 enzymes).
    
2. **Recognition:** poly-ubiquitinated protein binds to proteasome.
    
3. **Degradation:** protein cleaved into peptides; ubiquitin recycled.
    

**Clinical note:**

- Abnormal UPS function → protein aggregation diseases (e.g. Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s).
    
- Some cancer drugs (e.g. _bortezomib_) inhibit proteasomes to kill tumour cells.

## 🌍 Two Great Steps in Eukaryotic Evolution

### 1️⃣ Compartmentalisation

- Separation of incompatible reactions into organelles → efficiency ↑.
    
- Allows simultaneous specialised processes (e.g. protein synthesis in RER while ATP made in mitochondria).
    

**Analogy:**  
Imagine replacing a one-room studio (prokaryote) with a multi-room lab (eukaryote) — experiments no longer interfere.

### 2️⃣ Mitochondrial Endosymbiosis

- Ancient **archaeal cell engulfed a bacterium** capable of oxidative metabolism.
    
- Symbiosis: host provided shelter; bacterium provided ATP.
    
- Over time, bacterium became the **mitochondrion**.

## 🔋 Mitochondria – The Powerhouses

|Feature|Details|
|---|---|
|**Membranes**|Double membrane – outer smooth, inner folded (cristae)|
|**Matrix**|Contains enzymes for the TCA cycle + mitochondrial DNA|
|**Inner membrane**|Site of oxidative phosphorylation (ATP synthase, electron transport chain)|
|**Inheritance**|Maternal (from the ovum)|
|**Replication**|Independent binary fission|

### Function

- Generate > 90% of cellular **ATP**.
    
- Mediate **apoptosis**.
    
- Participate in **heat production** (brown fat).
    

⚕️ **Clinical Link:**  
Mitochondrial diseases (e.g. MELAS, LHON) → affect energy-hungry tissues (muscle, brain, eye).

## 🧱 Cytoskeleton – The Cell’s Framework

Provides **shape, strength, transport, and movement**.

|Component|Size|Composition|Function|Example|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Microtubules**|~25 nm|α- & β-tubulin|Tracks for vesicles, mitotic spindle|Kinesin/Dynein transport|
|**Microfilaments (Actin)**|~7 nm|Actin + myosin|Cell shape, movement, contraction|Muscle contraction, microvilli|
|**Intermediate Filaments**|10–12 nm|Keratin, vimentin, desmin, lamins|Tensile strength, nuclear support|Skin integrity, nuclear lamina|

🧠 **Analogy:**

- _Microtubules_ = railways
    
- _Actin filaments_ = muscle cables & scaffolding
    
- _Intermediate filaments_ = steel reinforcements
    

---

### Microvilli

- Tiny **actin-supported projections** of plasma membrane.
    
- Greatly **increase surface area** for absorption (e.g. small intestine).
    
- Dynamic — help with movement and phagocytosis.

## ⚕️ Cell Biology & Human Disease

Understanding organelles explains why diseases develop:

|Disease|Defect|Cellular Mechanism|
|---|---|---|
|**Cystic Fibrosis**|CFTR mutation|Misfolded Cl⁻ channel in RER|
|**Familial Hypercholesterolaemia**|LDLR mutation|Defective receptor-mediated endocytosis|
|**Lysosomal storage diseases**|Enzyme deficiencies|Accumulated macromolecules|
|**Hypertension (renal)**|Cell–cell adhesion defects|Impaired kidney filtration control|
|**Muscular dystrophy**|Cytoskeletal linkage defect|Weak sarcolemma attachments|
|**Congenital heart defects**|Abnormal cell migration|Faulty tissue morphogenesis|
|**Cancer**|Cell cycle/division errors|Uncontrolled proliferation|
|**Ageing**|Cumulative cell damage|Mitochondrial + proteasomal decline|

👉 _Every pathology begins at the cellular level._

## ✅ Key Points to Memorise

- **Golgi = postal service** → modifies and sorts proteins.
    
- **Kinesin → outward**, **Dynein → inward** transport along microtubules.
    
- **Lysosomes** need **M6P tag** to receive enzymes.
    
- **FH** = LDL receptor defect → high cholesterol.
    
- **Proteasomes** degrade ubiquitin-tagged proteins (ATP-dependent).
    
- **Compartmentalisation** = specialisation; **mitochondria** = endosymbiotic origin.
    
- **Mitochondria** have own DNA, double membrane, maternal inheritance.
    
- **Cytoskeleton:** microtubules (movement), actin (shape), intermediate filaments (strength).
    
- **Microvilli** = actin-based projections for absorption.
