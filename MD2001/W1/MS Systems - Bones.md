## *Functions of bone*

- Enables movement - attachment of muscles
- Protection of vital organs
- Structural support
- Storage of minerals
	- Ca$^{2+}$
	- PO$_4$$^{3-}$
	- Mg
- Haematopoiesis
	- Blood cell formation (in bone marrow)


## *What is bone?*

- Collagen fibre framework in a mucopolysaccharide - rich semisolid gel "ground substance"
	- gives bone its tensile strength
- Hardened by precipitation of calcium phosphate (hydroxyapatite) crystals within matrix
	- gives bone its compressional strength
		- cartilage is similar to bone but not calcified
- Structural strength near reinforced concrete but lighter
- Made of osteoblasts, osteocytes and osteoclasts
- Supplied by blood vessels and nerves
- Contains bone marrow

## *Long bone structure 1*

Long bone examples include: femur and humerus

**Epiphysis (head)
- Flared bone at the end
- Articular surface (connects to the joints)
- Covered by hyaline cartilage

**Metaphysis**
- Between epiphysis and diaphysis
- Region of growth in childhood

**Diaphysis (shaft)**
- Hollow cylinder (called medullary cavity)
- Contains bone marrow in marrow cavity (RBC formation)
- Nutrient foramen - blood supply

**Periosteum**
- Outer fibrous layer and inner fibrous layer
	- outer contains type 1 collagen, synthesized by osteoblast
		- contains blood vessels that can provide nutrients to the outer surface of bone
	- inner contains osteoprogenitor cells
		- can differentiate to osteoblast, contains bone lining
		- this layer is important for bone growth and repair
- Fibrous connective tissue sheath covering external surfaces. Cells include:
	- Fibroblasts - synthesize collagen
	- Mesenchymal cells - can differentiate into osteoblasts and chondroblasts
	- Osteoclasts
- Fibres from this periosteum can extend inside and anchor it to the surface of the bone - Perforating Fibres
	- more dense at sites where the tendons (of muscles) attach the periosteum

## *Long bone structure 2*

Two major kinds of bone

**Trabecular/Cancellous**
(spongy and porous)
- gives supporting strength to the ends of the weight-bearing bone
- allow distribution of stresses
	- e.g. around femoral head have high surface area for metabolism (regulation of Ca$^2$$^+$)
- horizontal trabeculae are important for strength

**Cortical**
(solid)
- bone on the outside forms the shaft of the long bone
- provides stiffness and strength
![[Long Bone 2 (2 major types).png]]

## *Blood supply to/from bone*

![[Long Bone Vessels.png]]

Haversian canals carry blood along the long axis of the bone.
Volkman's canals carry blood perpendicularly
Majority of cells in very close contact to blood vessels (micrometres away) but **not all cells in direct contact with blood supply osteocytes**


## *Cortical (compact) bone*

Anatomical/functional unit: osteon

- Haversian canals carry blood along bone
- Cells arranged in concentric circles (similar to onions)
- Inside each layer are collagen fibres
- Fibres in each layer can be oriented differently - very flexible
- Structure requires calcium hydroxyapatite (CaHA) to add strength and harden it
- Now strong and hard - not too brittle or too flexible

![[Cortical Bone Diagram.png]]


## *Spongy (aka cancellous/trabecular) bone*

Anatomical/functional unit: trabecula

- Fewer lamellular layers in the 'spongy' trabecular region
- Less coordinated (weaker and more flexible) than compact bone
- More open, less dense, site of haemopoiesis in bone marrow

![[Spongy Bone Diagram.png]]

## *Composition of bone matrix*

**Organic matrix**
- mostly protein fibres (collagen)
	- collagen is highly organised in parallel arrangement (in cortical and trabecular bone)

**Crystallised mineral salts (inorganic matrix)**
- calcium hydroxyapatite Ca$_{10}$(PO$_4$)$_6$(OH)$_2$

**Water**

**Common disorders:**
- Rickets:
	- Vitamin D deficiency - failure of Ca$^{2+}$ absorption
- Scurvy:
	- Vitamin C deficiency - lack of collagen

![[Composition of Bone (minerals).png]]

## *Bone cells terminology*

### **Osteoblast** (synthesis)
- bone forming cell, cover the surface of bone... forming an osseous matrix in which it becomes enclosed as an osteocyte

- mononucleate cells, derived from osteoprogenitor cells that line the surface of bone
- when stimulated to form bone will deposit organic matrix (collagen) then hydroxyapatite
- some become entombed during this process - which mature into osteocytes
- synthesis type 1 collagen
- produce adhesive glycoproteins
	- osteocalcin
	- osteonectin
		- these are important because they are needed to bind the calcium, which is used for mineralization of bone in terms of calcification

### **Osteoclast** (destruction)
- osteophage; a large, multinucleated cell derived from haematopoietic cells (stem cells)
- In response to mechanical stressed and physiological demands as they resorb bone matrix by demineralization

- multinucleate- several cells fuse together
- form a "sealing zone" on bone
- release H$^+$ and hydrolytic enzymes to dissolve the mineral, liberate calcium and break down the extracellular matrix
- regulated by hormones (e.g. oestrogens) and osteoblasts

### **Osteocyte** (maintenance)
- bone cell - trapped, "retired osteoblasts"
- Mature cells - embedded in lacunae (cavity in the bone), relatively inactive
- Maintain bone matrix through cell-to-cell communication (via projections in *canaliculi*) and influence bone remodelling. Mechanosensing.

- embedded within lacunae
- communicate via finger-like projections in canaliculi

**Osteoprogenitor cells**
- stem cell population, gives rise to osteoblasts (but also other cells)


---

## *Bone is a highly dynamic tissue*

Equilibrium between osteoblasts and osteoclast activity is controlled by signalling between the different cells in bone and via the actions of hormones:
- Calcitonin decreases the activity of osteoclasts, i.e. lower blood Ca$^{2+}$ levels
- Parathyroid hormone (PTH) increases activity of osteoclasts, releases Ca$^{2+}$


### *Trabecular (cancellous/spongy) bone remodelling cycle*

e.g. to deal with microdamage
Has role in regulating calcium

![[Trabecular Bone Remodelling Cycle.png]]


### *Cortical bone remodelling - overview*

- Osteoclasts reabsorb bone
- Osteoblasts lay down new matrix, eventually get surrounded and become
- Osteocytes

![[Cortical Bone Remodelling.png]]


---

### *Bone is dynamic and remodelled throughout life*

**Bone mass and density can increase*
- Excessive mechanical stimulation

**Bone mass and density can decrease**
- Non-weight bearing (immobilisation)
- Sex-hormone deficiency (e.g. menopause)
- Endocrine/nutritional disorders

**Wolff's law**
- Bone adapts to the load under which it is placed
- Weight-bearing exercise, orthodontic braces, head binding etc


### *Age related changes in bone mass*

![[Age related changes in bone mass graph.png]]


#### *Bone growth from fetus to adult*

**Cartilage model**
- formed by chondroblasts
- reshaped by chondrocytes

**Replaced by bone (ossification)**
- endochondral (long bones)
- intramembranous (flat bones)

Bone growth begins in the shaft during fetal life

##### *Fetal endochondral ossification*
- ossification begins in the diaphysis
- primary ossification centre is active before birth

##### *After-birth endochondral ossification*
- after birth, bone begins to develop in the ends of the bone (epiphysis - secondary centre of ossification)


---

### *Bone growth at the epiphyseal plate*

Bone is laid down in the shaft(diaphysis) and in the head
The bony parts are separated by a plate of cartilage
As long as the plate of cartilage is present and active, the bone will increase in length

![[Epiphyseal plate bone growth (1).png]]
![[Epiphyseal plate bone growth (2).png]]


---

### *Fusion of epiphyseal plates*

Occurs by the end of puberty
![[Epiphyseal cartilage fusion.png]]

### *Fractures and woven bone*

Depends on cells in the local periosteum

**Takes 2-4 weeks for healing**
- dependent of the severity and position of the fracture and age of patient

Inflammation and additional blood flow lead to
**Callus formation**
- osteoblasts quickly form woven bone, to bridge the gap
- woven bone is weak as the collagen fibres are irregular

**Lamellar bone laid down**
- collagen organised in regular sheets to gives strength and resilience


### **Types of Bones**


| Bone type | Example                         | Function                           |

| Flat      | Skull, ribs, sternum, scapula   | Protection & muscle attachment     |
| Irregular | Vertebrae, pelvis, facial bones | Complex shape, support, protection |
| Sesamoid  | Patella                         | Protect tendon, increase leverage  |
| Sutural   | Small bones in skull sutures    | Developmental accessory bones      |
