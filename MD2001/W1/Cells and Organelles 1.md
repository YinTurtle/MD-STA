## 🔬 A Brief History of the Cell

- **Robert Hooke (1665)** observed “pores” in cork using an early microscope — these were **cell walls** of dead plant tissue.
    
- **Theodor Schwann & Matthias Schleiden (1839)** proposed the **Cell Theory**:
    
    - All living things are made of cells.
        
    - The cell is the fundamental unit of life.
        
- **Rudolf Virchow (1855)** extended this to include disease:
    
    > “Omnis cellula e cellula” – _All cells arise from pre-existing cells._
    
    - This made pathology a _cellular science_ — diseases start from abnormal cell function.
        

### 🧠 Key idea

Every living organism is built from cells — understanding how a cell functions = understanding how the body works (and how disease develops).

## 🧫 What Is a Cell?

**Definition:**  
The smallest _structural_ and _functional_ unit of life capable of carrying out all necessary processes (metabolism, growth, response, reproduction).

**Advanced Cell Theory adds:**

- All energy flow (metabolism) occurs within cells.
    
- Cells carry DNA (hereditary material).
    
- All cells share basic chemical composition.

## 📏 Relative Size of Cells

|Structure|Approx. Size|Example|
|---|---|---|
|Virus|0.1 µm|Influenza virus|
|Bacteria|1–10 µm|_E. coli_|
|Animal cell|10–100 µm|Liver cell|
|Red blood cell|7–8 µm|Human RBC|
|Nucleus|~5 µm|In eukaryotic cell|

👉 **Analogy:** If a human cell were the size of a football stadium, a protein would be about the size of a football.

## ⚙️ Properties of Cells

- **Cells are microscopic but independent**: each acts as a tiny living factory.
    
- **Arise from pre-existing cells** (via division).
    
- **Finite lifespan**: they age and die (apoptosis, necrosis).
    
- **Adapt and respond** to environment (e.g. muscle cells contract, nerve cells transmit signals).
    

> 💡 Think of each cell as a “mini-city”: it has borders (membrane), power stations (mitochondria), factories (ribosomes), and waste disposal systems (lysosomes).

## 🧱 The Cell (Plasma) Membrane

**Function:**

- Protective **barrier** that separates intracellular (ICF) and extracellular (ECF) environments.
    
- **Semipermeable** — controls entry/exit of substances.
    
- Allows **communication and recognition** between cells.
    

**Structure:**

- **Phospholipid bilayer** + **proteins** + **cholesterol**
    
- Hydrophilic (water-loving) heads face out; hydrophobic tails face inward.
    
- Fluid and flexible, not static.
    

### 🧠 Analogy:

Imagine the membrane as a **soap bubble with embedded boats** — the soap layer is the lipid bilayer, and the boats a re proteins floating around.

---

## 🧬 The Fluid Mosaic Model (Singer & Nicolson, 1972)

- Describes the plasma membrane as a **dynamic mosaic** of **lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates**.
    
- “Fluid” = components move within the layer; “mosaic” = different molecules embedded.
    

**Components:**

- **Phospholipids** – form bilayer (main structure).
    
- **Cholesterol** – adds rigidity and stabilises fluidity.
    
- **Proteins** – perform most functions.
    
- **Carbohydrates** – act as recognition markers (e.g. blood group antigens).
    

**Membrane asymmetry:**

- Outer leaflet: phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin
    
- Inner leaflet: phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol

## 🧩 Types of Membrane Proteins

|Type|Function|Example|
|---|---|---|
|**Integral (transmembrane)**|Span entire bilayer|Ion channels, receptors|
|**Peripheral**|Loosely attached to surface|Enzymes, cytoskeletal anchors|

### **Major activities:**

1. **Channel proteins** – allow passive flow of ions/molecules (e.g. Na⁺, Cl⁻).
    
2. **Carrier proteins** – bind and transport molecules (active or passive).
    
3. **Receptors** – bind hormones or neurotransmitters (e.g. insulin receptor, ACE2).
    
4. **Enzymes** – catalyse reactions at the membrane.
    
5. **Linkers/Anchors** – connect cytoskeleton or other cells.
    
6. **Cell identity markers** – “self” recognition (important in immunity).

## ⚕️ Clinical Relevance: Transport Proteins

**Cystic Fibrosis**

- Defective chloride channel due to **CFTR gene mutation** (an ABC transporter).
    
- Leads to thick mucus in lungs and pancreas → chronic infections, poor digestion.
    
- Example of **how protein misfolding or transport defects cause disease**.

## 🧫 Two Cell Types: Prokaryotes vs Eukaryotes

|Feature|**Prokaryote**|**Eukaryote**|
|---|---|---|
|Nucleus|❌ Absent (nucleoid region)|✅ Present (true nucleus)|
|DNA|Single circular|Multiple linear chromosomes|
|Organelles|None (no membranes)|Membrane-bound organelles|
|Size|1–10 µm|10–100 µm|
|Example|_E. coli_, _Strep._|Human, plant, fungi cells|
All bacteria are prokaryotes, but viruses are neither prokaryote nor eukaryote.
Viruses cannot replicate outside the host cells

**Analogy:**  
A prokaryote is like a **studio apartment** — all in one room.  
A eukaryote is a **multi-room house** — separate rooms for cooking, sleeping, etc. (specialised functions).

## 🧬 Eukaryotic Cell Structure and Organisation

Eukaryotic cells contain **organelles**, each with a specialised role:

- **Nucleus** – DNA storage, transcription.
    
- **Ribosomes** – protein synthesis.
    
- **RER & SER** – protein and lipid modification.
    
- **Golgi apparatus** – packaging and secretion.
    
- **Lysosomes & peroxisomes** – degradation/detox.
    
- **Mitochondria** – energy production (ATP).
    
- **Cytoskeleton** – shape and transport.
    

---

## 🧠 Protein Expression: The Central Dogma

**DNA → mRNA → Protein**

1. **Transcription** (in nucleus): DNA copied into mRNA.
    
2. **Translation** (in cytoplasm): mRNA decoded by **ribosomes** → amino acid chain (protein).
    

**DNA organisation:**

- DNA + histones = **chromatin**
    
    - _Euchromatin_: loosely packed, active genes
        
    - _Heterochromatin_: dense, inactive
        
- **Nucleolus**: assembles ribosomes.
    

---

## 🧬 Rough and Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum

|Type|Structure|Function|
|---|---|---|
|**Rough ER**|Ribosomes attached|Protein synthesis, modification, quality control|
|**Smooth ER**|No ribosomes|Lipid synthesis, detoxification, steroid production|

- Proteins with a **signal sequence** enter RER for folding and modification (e.g. insulin precursor).
    
- Misfolded proteins trigger **ER stress** (important in CF, Alzheimer’s).

## 📦 Golgi Apparatus and Secretory Pathway

**RER → Golgi → Secretory vesicle → Plasma membrane**

1. RER packages proteins into vesicles.
    
2. Vesicles travel to **Golgi complex** for further processing (glycosylation, phosphorylation).
    
3. Sorted and sent to destinations:
    
    - Plasma membrane
        
    - Lysosomes (mannose-6-phosphate tag)
        
    - Secretion outside cell (exocytosis)
        

**Clinical link:**  
Defects in vesicle trafficking cause diseases like **insulin secretion disorders** and **lysosomal storage diseases**.

---

### ⚕️ Example – Insulin

- Synthesised as **proinsulin** in RER → processed in **Golgi** → stored in **vesicles** → released via **exocytosis**.

## 🧠 Summary Table – Key Organelles and Functions

|Organelle|Function|Clinical Example|
|---|---|---|
|Nucleus|DNA storage, transcription|Cancer (mutations)|
|Ribosome|Protein synthesis|Antibiotics target bacterial ribosomes|
|RER|Protein folding, glycosylation|CF, ER stress|
|SER|Lipid/steroid synthesis, detox|Liver drug metabolism|
|Golgi|Sorting, packaging|Lysosomal enzyme tagging defects|
|Lysosome|Breakdown of waste|Tay-Sachs, Gaucher|
|Mitochondria|Energy (ATP)|Mitochondrial diseases|
|Cytoskeleton|Shape, movement|Muscular dystrophy|

✅ **Key Takeaways (to memorise)**

- “All cells come from pre-existing cells” — foundation of pathology.
    
- Plasma membrane = phospholipid bilayer + proteins + cholesterol.
    
- CFTR = chloride channel defect → cystic fibrosis.
    
- Prokaryotes lack nucleus; eukaryotes have nucleus + organelles.
    
- RER = protein synthesis; SER = lipid/steroid synthesis.
    
- Golgi = modification and sorting centre.
    
- Proteins destined for lysosomes get **mannose-6-phosphate** tag.
