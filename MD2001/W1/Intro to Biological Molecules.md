### Learning Outcomes:

- Define the different types of chemical bonds and give examples of their function in inter- and intramolecular interactions within biological systems
- Categorise the different major classes of biomolecules
- Distinguish between classes of biomolecules and their functions but recognise that they interact
- Explain how biomolecules are covalently linked to form macromolecular structures
- Describe the function of macromolecular structures in living systems
- Justify the importance of maintaining ion concentrations across a membrane

---

### *Ionic Bonds*

- Gain and loss of electrons
- Electrostatic attraction
- Soluble in water
![[Ionic bonds.png]]

#### *Maintaining ion concentrations is critical*

**Isotonic solution**
- normal

**Hypotonic solution**
- dilute
- could lead to swollen or ruptured of red blood cell (hemolysis)

**Hypertonic solution**
- concentrated
- could lead to shrunken red blood cell (crenation)

### *Covalent Bonds*

- Sharing electrons
- Can be one from each partner or more
- Determines the shape of the molecule
![[Covalent bonds.png]]

### *Polar bonds*

- Not all electrons are shared equally
- Due to electrostatic interactions

#### *Van der Waals forces*

- weak electrostatic interaction between atoms
	- weaker than both ionic and covalent
- induced dipoles formed when electrons in one atom or molecule temporarily shift
	- causing one side to have a temporary positive pole that attracts the negative pole of neighbouring atoms

### *Biological Molecules*
- sugars
- fatty acids
- steroids
- amino acids
- nucleotides

##### *Sugars*

- have the general structure (CH$_2$O)$_n$
- can adopt different shapes
- source of energy for cell
![[Sugars Examples.png]]

**Carbohydrates**
- sugars can be joined together
- can be stored
[[Intro to Carbohydrates]]

##### *Fatty Acids*

- can be saturated or unsaturated
- can be both hydrophilic or hydrophobic
![[Saturated and Unsaturated Fatty Acids.png]]
- Can be stored as triacylglycerol
![[Triacylglycerols Diagram.png]]
- Important component of cells membranes

##### *Steroids*

- 4 fused carbon rings
- functional groups attached
![[Steroids Example.png]]![[Steroids Example(s) - more.png]]

##### *Amino Acids*
![[Amino Acids Example.png]]- can be merged to form a peptide chain
![[Peptide Chain Example.png]]

**Other uses of amino acids**
- sources of enegy
- neurotransmitters
	- e.g. glutamic acid
- precursors for other molecules
	- e.g. glycine precursor for porphyrin ring

##### *Nucleotides*

- Nitrogen ring linked to a five carbon sugar
- Sugar can be ribose or deoxyribose
- Phosphate groups
![[Nucleotides (Ribose - phosphate groups) Example.png]]
- They store short term energy
	- ATP and GTP
![[ATP and GTP Example.png]]
- Store of electrons
	- NAD, NADP reducing store for biosynthesis or ATP reduction
- Cofactors for enzymes
- Signalling molecules (e.g. cAMP)
- Building blocks for nucleic acid
	- DNA or RNA

### *Biomolecules can be hybrids*

e.g. Glycoprotein and glycolipid

The structure determines the immune response.
- Its three dimensional structure is very important
	![[3D structural comparison Biomolecules.png]]
- Errors in proteins folding cause diseases
- Changes in DNA structure can lead to mutation
- Function of biomolecules is determined by their composition, bonds and structure
