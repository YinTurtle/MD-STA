# 🧠 **2. Why Study Ion Channel Function? (Slides 3–5)**

Slide 4 shows Hodgkin & Huxley (Nobel 1963) — pioneers of ion channel electrophysiology.  
Slide 5: 2021 Nobel Prize → **Julius & Patapoutian** for temperature & touch receptors (TRP channels, Piezo channels).  

**Key message:**  
Ion channels underlie:

- Action potentials
    
- Muscle contraction
    
- Cardiac rhythm
    
- Sensation (temperature, touch, pain)
    
- Hormone secretion
    

Mutations → **channelopathies** (arrhythmias, epilepsy, MH, CPVT, periodic paralysis).

# ⚡ **3. Measuring Ion Channel Current (Slides 6–11)**

## **Ohm’s Law (Slide 7)**

> V = I × R

- V in mV
    
- I in pA
    
- R in MΩ  
      
    Used to calculate **conductance** (g = 1/R).
    

---

## **A. Patch Clamp Technique (Slides 8–9)**

Nobel Prize 1991 → Neher & Sakmann.

Slide 8 shows:

- A glass pipette forms a giga-seal with the cell membrane
    
- Allows **direct recording** of ionic currents through **single channels** or **whole cells**  
    

Modes include:

- **Voltage clamp** (fix V, measure I)
    
- **Current clamp** (fix I, measure V)
    

Slide 9 diagram:

- Ion channels → amplifier → digitiser → computer
    
- Typical single-channel trace on right (square openings).

---

# 🔍 **4. What We Can Learn From Single-Channel Recordings (Slides 12–20)**

---

## **4.1 What Opens a Channel? (Slide 13)**

Channels may be gated by:

- **Voltage** → VG Na⁺, VG K⁺ channels
    
- **Ligand (external)** → glutamate receptors
    
- **Ligand (internal second messenger)** → RyR opened by Ca²⁺
    
- **Stretch** → mechanosensitive (Piezo)
    
- **Light** → channelrhodopsin  
    

---

## **4.2 Channel Gating (Slides 14–15)**

Slide 14 shows real RyR2 single-channel trace:

- Upward deflections = openings
    
- Down = closed
    
- Stochastic behaviour (random open/close)
    

Slide 15 defines:

- **Open duration**
    
- **Closed duration**
    
- **ΔI** = amplitude of single-channel current
    
- **Po (open probability)** = t_open / t_total  
    

Po increases with agonists or depolarisation.

---

## **4.3 Kinetic Models of Gating (Slide 16)**

Diagram shows:  
A + R ⇌ AR ⇌ AR*

- **kon/koff** → affinity
    
- **α/β** → efficacy (opening/closing rates)  
    

These are state-transition models for ligand-gated channels.

---

## **4.4 Single-Channel Conductance (Slide 17)**

Conductance (g) = 1/R  
Measured from **single-channel current (I)** at different **voltages (V)** → slope of I–V curve.

Slides show:

- Na⁺ channels: larger inward currents
    
- K⁺ channels: outward currents  
    

---

## **4.5 Whole-Cell Current vs Single Channels (Slide 18)**

Equation on slide:  
**I = N × Po × i**  
Where:

- N = number of channels
    
- Po = open probability
    
- i = unitary current
    

Slide shows ensemble averages vs whole-cell current traces (Patlak & Ortiz 1985).  

---

## **4.6 Ion Selectivity (Slide 19)**

Use **I–V relationship** and **reversal potential (E_rev)**.

Slide example:

- Shift in E_rev with different K⁺ concentrations → consistent with **Nernst equation**
    

> E_ion = (RT/zF) ln([ion]_out/[ion]_in)  

Conclusion from slide: **K⁺ ions are flowing through the channel**.

---

## **4.7 Channel Inhibitors (Slide 20)**

Classic selective blockers:

- **Tetrodotoxin (TTX)** → blocks VG Na⁺ channels
    
- **Tetraethylammonium (TEA)** → blocks VG K⁺ channels  
    

---

# 🔥 **5. Ion Channels & Calcium Signalling (Slides 21–27)**

Slides 21–23 show the central importance of Ca²⁺ homeostasis.

---

## **5.1 Ca²⁺ Concentrations (Slide 21)**

- Cytosol: **~100 nM**
    
- ER/SR lumen: **~1 mM**
    
- Lysosomes: also high Ca²⁺  
    

**Ca²⁺ is life–death signalling**:

- Required for: fertilisation, secretion, heartbeat, contraction
    
- Excess Ca²⁺ → apoptosis, ischemia, excitotoxicity, arrhythmias, **malignant hyperthermia**
    

Slide shows **TPC2** channels in lysosomes.

---

## **5.2 Cardiac Excitation–Contraction Coupling (Slides 22–24)**

### **L-type Ca²⁺ channel (LTCC)** (on plasma membrane)

- AP arrives → LTCC opens → Ca²⁺ influx
    

### **RyR2 (Ryanodine Receptor 2)**

- Ca²⁺ influx triggers **calcium-induced calcium release (CICR)** from SR
    
- Produces contraction
    

### **SERCA**

- Pumps Ca²⁺ back into SR → relaxation
    

Slide 23 shows RyR2 macromolecular complex:

- Bound to **FKBP12.6, calsequestrin, triadin, junctin**  
    

---

## **5.3 CPVT — Channelopathy of RyR2 (Slide 24)**

Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT):

- Autosomal dominant
    
- Triggered by **stress/exercise**
    
- Symptoms: syncope, dizziness, **sudden death**
    
- > 69 mutations in **RyR2** identified  
    

Mechanism:

- Mutant RyR2 channels **leak Ca²⁺** → arrhythmias
    
- Especially during catecholaminergic stimulation (β-adrenergic ↑ PKA phosphorylation)
    

---

## **5.4 Skeletal Muscle Excitation–Contraction Coupling (Slides 25–27)**

### **LTCC (DHPR)** mechanically coupled to **RyR1**

Unlike the heart, skeletal muscle RyR1 activation is **mechanical**, not Ca²⁺-induced.  

Process:

- AP → LTCC conformational change
    
- Direct physical coupling → RyR1 opens
    
- Ca²⁺ release → contraction
    
- SERCA → reuptake
    

---

## **5.5 Malignant Hyperthermia (Slide 27)**

Due to RyR1 mutations.  
Trigger: volatile anaesthetics or depolarising relaxants (succinylcholine).  
Symptoms intraoperatively:

- Muscle rigidity
    
- Hyperthermia
    
- Acidosis
    
- Tachycardia
    

Mechanism:

- RyR1 becomes **hyperactive** → massive Ca²⁺ release → metabolic crisis  
    

Treatment: **Dantrolene** (RyR inhibitor) — not listed on slides but well-known.
