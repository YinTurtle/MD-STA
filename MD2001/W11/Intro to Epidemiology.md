# **Learning Outcomes (Slide 2)**

You should be able to:

- Define mortality rate, incidence, prevalence
    
- Describe **time, place, person** in epidemiological enquiry
    
- Calculate **prevalence + incidence**, and understand what alters them
    
- Distinguish **exposures vs outcomes**
    
- Explain **hierarchy of evidence** and **study designs**
    
- Define **confounding + bias** and their impact on interpretation

# **2. What is Epidemiology? (Slide 3)**

Epidemiology =

> _Scientific, systematic, data-driven study of the distribution and determinants of health-related states/events in populations and application to control health problems._  
> (Examples: neighbourhood, school, city, country, global).  

Key phrases in definition:

- **Distribution** → frequency & patterns
    
- **Determinants** → causes, risk factors
    
- **Populations** → not individuals
    
- **Application** → public health, prevention, policy
    

---

# **3. Factors Influencing Disease Epidemiology (Slide 4)**

- Communicable vs non-communicable
    
- Mode of transmission (air, water, contact…)
    
- Host susceptibility: genetics, immunity, nutrition
    
- Environment
    
- Behaviours (hygiene, masking, smoking)
    
- Pathogen virulence
    
- Vaccination levels  
    

---

# **4. Epidemiologic Triangle (Slide 5)**

Diagram: **Host – Agent – Environment** triangle.

- **Agent** = pathogen / “what”
    
- **Host** = person affected / “who”
    
- **Environment** = enabling factors / “where”
    

➡️ **Goal in outbreak:** Break ANY side of the triangle (e.g., blocking transmission, vaccination, sanitation).  

---

# **5. Basic Epidemiological Terms (Slide 6)**

(Section heading slide)

---

# **6. Mortality Rate (Slide 7)**

Mortality rate =

> Portion of a population that dies during a specified time period.

Important: **needs denominator + time frame**  
Examples show why “50 deaths” alone is meaningless without population and time.  

---

# **7. Case Fatality Rate (CFR) (Slide 8)**

CFR =

> % of _known cases_ that die within a specified period.

Weaknesses:

1. Early outbreak → underestimated
    
2. Testing limited to severe cases → overestimation
    
3. Assumes all cases are tested
    

Best estimate: proportion of all cases (large denominator).  

---

# **8. Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) (Slide 9)**

IFR =

> Total deaths ÷ _total infected_ (symptomatic + asymptomatic)

More accurate for pathogens with many asymptomatic cases (e.g., SARS-CoV-2).  
But limited by incomplete testing.  

---

# **9. Infection Rates & R₀ (Slide 10)**

R₀ = number of secondary cases from one case in fully susceptible population.

Key points:

- Spread less likely when **R₀ < 1**
    
- R₀ increases with behaviour, virulence, environment
    
- Not a fixed biological constant  
    

---

# **10. Denominators (Slide 11)**

Denominator = population at risk over a time.  
Must MATCH numerator. Examples: city, hospital, health board, disease register.  

---

# **11. Time Frame / Person-Time (Slide 12–13)**

Person-time = number of people × time at risk.  
Example:

- 1000 people × 1 year = 1000 person-years.
    

Person-time accommodates:

- Different follow-up durations
    
- Loss to follow-up
    

Slide 13 shows a real student question answered:  
“n-year follow-up” = time participants are observed.  

---

# **12. Incidence (Slide 14)**

Incidence = **new cases**.

Two forms:

### **A. Incidence proportion / cumulative incidence**

= (New cases ÷ population at risk) × 100,000

### **B. Incidence rate** (using person-time)

= (New cases ÷ total person-time) × 100,000  

- Useful for identifying causes / risk factors.
    

---

# **13. Prevalence (Slide 15)**

Prevalence = **existing cases** / total population.

- **Point prevalence** → at a specific time
    
- **Period prevalence** → over a period
    

Useful for:

- Disease **burden**
    
- **Service planning**  
    

---

# **14. Incidence vs Prevalence (Slide 16)**

Table on slide:

|Incidence|Prevalence|
|---|---|
|A rate/proportion|A proportion|
|Identifies _causes_|Identifies _burden_|
|Only in people without disease|Depends on incidence & duration|

Question posed: “Which should worry us?” → depends on goal: prevention vs service planning.  

---

# **15. Epidemiologist’s Bathtub Model (Slide 17)**

Illustration:

- **Tap** = incidence
    
- **Water in tub** = prevalence
    
- **Steam** = recovery
    
- **Drain** = mortality
    

Prevalence rises when:

- Incidence ↑
    
- Recovery ↓
    
- Death ↓  
    

---

# **16. Patterns of Outcome Occurrence (Slide 18)**

- **Sporadic** – occasional & irregular
    
- **Endemic** – persistent background
    
- **Outbreak** – more cases than expected
    
- **Epidemic** – sudden ↑ cases over expected
    
- **Pandemic** – epidemic across continents
    

COVID-19 example given.  

---

# **17. Outcomes (Slide 20)**

Examples:

- Death
    
- Hospitalisation
    
- First diagnosis
    
- Recurrence
    
- QoL
    
- Surrogate markers (BP, lung function)  
    

---

# **18. Exposures (Slide 21)**

- **Non-modifiable**: age, sex, genotype
    
- **Modifiable**: smoking, weight, diet
    
- **Interventions** (a special exposure): medication, surgery, lifestyle advice  
    

---

# **19. Effect Estimates (Slides 22–28)**

### Risk

= (Number with outcome ÷ total group) × 100

### Relative Risk (RR)

= Risk in exposed ÷ risk in unexposed

### Relative Risk Reduction (RRR)

= (1 – RR) × 100

### Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR)

= Risk in control – risk in exposed

### Number Needed to Treat (NNT)

= 1 ÷ ARR

Worked example on slide 28:

- RR = 0.77
    
- RRR = 23%
    
- ARR = 3%
    
- NNT = **33**  
    

---

# **20. Confidence Intervals (Slides 30–37)**

- CI = range of **plausible values**
    
- Wider CI = more uncertainty
    
- Examples:
    
    - RR 0.77 (CI 0.60–0.98)
        
    - ARR 3% (CI 0.2–5.8)
        
    - NNT 33 (CI 17–145)
        

CI diagram (slide 32) visually illustrates uncertainty.  

---

# **21. Study Designs (Slides 38–46)**

### **Cross-sectional**

- Snapshot in time
    
- Measures **prevalence**
    
- Identifies associations  
    

### **Case-control**

- Cases with outcome vs controls without
    
- Looks backward for exposures
    
- For rare diseases
    
- Produces **odds ratios**  
    

### **Cohort**

- Exposure → outcome over time
    
- Prospective or retrospective
    
- Gives **risk**, **incidence**, **RR**  
    

### **Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs)**

- Random allocation to exposure
    
- Gold standard for **intervention**
    
- Produces high-quality evidence

# **22. Hierarchy of Evidence (Slides 40 & 53)**

At the top (least bias):

- Systematic reviews / meta-analyses
    
- RCTs  
    Middle: cohort → case-control → cross-sectional  
    Lowest: expert opinion / anecdotes  
    

---

# **23. Confounding (Slide 51)**

Diagram: ice cream vs murder, confounded by **season**.  
Definition:

> A distortion of the true relationship between exposure and outcome by a third variable.  

---

# **24. Bias (Slide 52)**

Bias = **systematic error** in:

- Data collected
    
- How collected
    
- How analysed
    
- How interpreted
    
- How reported
    

Effects:

- Incorrect conclusions about **causation** or **effectiveness**
