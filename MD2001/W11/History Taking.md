# **Learning Outcomes (Slides 1–2)**

You should be able to:

- Understand the **framework** of a medical history
    
- Understand its **role in diagnosis**
    
- Understand the **skills** required to take an effective medical history  
    

---

# **2. Why History Taking Matters (Slide 3)**

A medical history is the **first step in clinical reasoning**. It helps you:

- Form a **differential diagnosis**
    
- Place health in **clinical + social context**
    
- Identify **risk factors**
    
- Direct **examination**

**Big picture:**  
History → guides exam → guides investigations → guides management

> **80% of diagnoses in general practice are made from HISTORY alone.**

# 🩹 **8. History of Presenting Complaint – Principles (Slides 9–13)**

### **Aim:**

To gather a **detailed**, **chronological**, **clinically relevant** account of the problem.

### Key Techniques:

- Allow patient to talk
    
- Use open → closed questions
    
- Facilitate conversation
    
- Establish **timeline** from first symptom → now
    
- Tailor HPC to the system involved  
    (e.g., for cough: sputum, breathlessness, fever, wheeze)  
    

### **Clinical reasoning while listening (Slide 11):**

- Keep differential diagnoses in mind
    
- Ask yourself: “What else do I need to rule in/out?”
    
- Summarise mid-way if useful
    

### **Clarifying questions (Slide 12):**

- Acute vs chronic
    
- Onset
    
- Duration
    
- Frequency
    
- Severity
    
- Character
