## Part 1: What Actually Is Disease?

### Defining Disease

At first glance, "disease" seems obvious. A person feels ill, we find something wrong, we call it disease. But it's much more complicated than that.

A disease is fundamentally a **deviation from normal function or structure that causes suffering, dysfunction, or has the potential to do so.** However, this definition immediately runs into problems because "normal" is subjective and culturally dependent.

### Key Characteristics of Disease

**1. Biological abnormality** – There's something structurally or functionally wrong with the body
**2. Impaired function** – The body can't do what it's supposed to do
**3. Symptoms or signs** – The person experiences discomfort or we can detect abnormalities
**4. Suffering or distress** – There's genuine impact on wellbeing
**5. Social or cultural context** – What counts as disease depends on expectations and values

### Why This Matters: The Tricky Cases

Consider these scenarios:

**Example 1: Diabetes**

- A patient presents with headaches, thirst, and nocturia (getting up at night to urinate)
- Investigations show high blood glucose

_But what IS the disease?_ Is it:

- Diabetes mellitus itself (the high blood sugar)?
- Or is it atherosclerosis, peripheral vascular disease, myocardial ischaemia, kidney failure, and susceptibility to infection that develop because of diabetes?

**The answer:** All of it. Diabetes is not a single disease—it's a condition that affects multiple systems. Naming it requires capturing all this complexity.

**Example 2: Down Syndrome**

- A person has trisomy 21 (three copies of chromosome 21)
- They have intellectual disability
- They may also have congenital heart disease, thyroid problems, increased cancer risk

_Is this disease?_ Medically, yes—there are biological abnormalities. But some argue it's also a form of human neurodiversity. This raises profound ethical questions about how we classify and value human variation.

**Example 3: Psychosis or Cultural Experience?**

- A person reports hearing voices and seeing visions
- In their cultural context, this might be interpreted as spiritual awakening
- In another context, it's a psychiatric emergency

The _biological substrate_ might be the same, but the interpretation—and whether it counts as "disease"—is cultural.

**Example 4: Old Age or Dementia?**

- An elderly person forgets things and moves slowly
- Is this normal aging or disease?
- At what point does it become pathological?

These boundary cases show us that **disease classification is not purely objective—it involves values, culture, and social context alongside biology.**

## Part 2: How We Classify Disease

### Why We Need Classification

Classification systems aren't academic luxuries—they serve critical purposes:

|Purpose|Why It Matters|
|---|---|
|**Understanding & Communication**|Everyone needs to speak the same language; a "pneumonia" in London should mean the same thing as "pneumonia" in Lagos|
|**Prognosis**|Different types of the same disease (e.g., melanoma vs. basal cell carcinoma) have vastly different outcomes|
|**Treatment**|Classification determines which drugs work; a bacterial pneumonia needs antibiotics, viral doesn't|
|**Prediction**|We can identify risk factors and predict who will get sick|
|**Epidemiology**|We track disease patterns across populations and time to understand public health trends|

### The Four Main Classification Approaches

#### 1. **Anatomical Classification**

_"Where is it?"_

This is about **location in the body.**

**Example:** Vascular anomaly in the brain vs. peripheral vascular disease. Same general problem (abnormal blood vessels), but the location changes everything about severity and treatment.

**Advantages:** Simple, intuitive, helps with localization for surgery or imaging **Limitations:** Doesn't tell you the cause or how it works

#### 2. **Functional Classification**

_"What can't the body do?"_

This focuses on **loss of function or the symptoms experienced.**

**Example:**

- "Migraine" — classified by the headache pattern and associated symptoms
- "Sore head" — a general loss of normal head function

**Advantages:** Directly relates to what the patient experiences; useful for treatment aims **Limitations:** Same function loss can have different causes requiring different treatments

#### 3. **Biological/Pathological Classification**

_"What's actually wrong at the tissue level?"_

This describes the **underlying pathological process.**

**Example:**

- Haemorrhage (bleeding)
- Tumour (abnormal cell growth)
- Trauma (tissue damage from injury)
- Inflammation
- Degeneration

**Advantages:** Gets at the mechanism; points toward treatment **Limitations:** Doesn't consider the person's experience or social context

#### 4. **Systems/Precision Medicine Classification** (Integrationist)

_"What's the whole picture?"_

This combines **anatomical, functional, biological, and now genomic/molecular data** into a comprehensive classification.

**Example:** Instead of just "lung cancer," we now say: "Non-small cell lung cancer, adenocarcinoma, Stage IIIB, with EGFR mutation and PD-L1 expression >50%"

**Advantages:** Provides maximum information for personalized treatment; predicts response to therapy **Limitations:** Complex, expensive, requires advanced technology

### Real-World Example: The Problem with Simple Classification

**Scenario: Colon Cancer**

A patient has an abdominal mass found to be colonic adenocarcinoma.

**Is that enough information for treatment?**

Absolutely not. We need to know:

- **How far has it spread?** (local vs. metastatic changes everything)
- **How aggressive is it?** (histological grade predicts behavior)
- **What genetic features does it show?** (microsatellite instability, mismatch repair status, BRAF mutations determine drug sensitivity)
- **Is there familial syndrome?** (Lynch syndrome, FAP — changes surveillance and family management)
- **What's the stage?** (TNM staging predicts prognosis and guides treatment intensity)

Same diagnosis. Completely different diseases in terms of prognosis and treatment. This is why **classification must be multidimensional.**

## Part 3: Key Disease Nomenclature Terms

### The Language of Pathology

Understanding these terms is essential for reading pathology reports and medical records.

| Term                                                     | Definition                                                                                                                                                            | Example                                                                                                |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Aetiology**                                            | The _cause_ of disease — what triggered it<br>(combination of genetic and environmental factors)<br>(The same aetiology may lead to different pathological endpoints) | Smoking (aetiology of lung cancer)                                                                     |
| **Pathogenesis**                                         | The _mechanism_ by which the cause produces disease — the chain of events<br>(different process for every patient)                                                    | Smoking → lung inflammation → DNA damage → malignant transformation                                    |
| **Pathology**                                            | The _structural and functional changes_ that result from disease                                                                                                      | Squamous cell carcinoma of lung (the actual tissue abnormality)                                        |
| **Syndrome**                                             | A collection of signs and symptoms that occur together — often of unknown cause                                                                                       | Down syndrome (multiple features: intellectual disability, characteristic facies, heart disease, etc.) |
| **Idiopathic**                                           | Disease where the cause is **unknown** — even with modern investigation<br>"We don't know the cause"                                                                  | Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (scarring of the lungs with no identified cause)                         |
| **Manifestations** (clinical, morphological, functional) | The consequence of the disease.                                                                                                                                       | Rash is a manifestation that is "due to" psoriasis                                                     |

### The Dissociation Between Aetiology and Outcome

**Critical concept:** The same cause can lead to different outcomes, and the same outcome can have different causes.

**Same aetiology → different outcomes:**

- _Haemophilus influenzae_ can cause:
    - Nothing (colonizes nasopharynx asymptomatically)
    - Sniffles (mild respiratory infection)
    - Pneumonia (lung infection)
    - Meningitis (CNS infection)
    - Epiglottitis (life-threatening airway emergency)

**Same outcome → different aetiology:**

- Cirrhosis can result from:
    - Alcohol (most common in UK)
    - Chronic viral hepatitis (A, B, C, E)
    - Autoimmune hepatitis
    - Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC)
    - Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)
    - Metabolic disease (haemochromatosis, Wilson's disease)
    - Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)

**Why this matters:** You can't treat cirrhosis effectively without knowing its cause. An alcoholic with cirrhosis needs alcohol cessation support. A patient with PBC might need ursodeoxycholic acid. Viral hepatitis B cirrhosis might benefit from antivirals.

### Nomenclature of Pathological Processes

When describing disease, we often classify the underlying process:

**Disorders of Growth**

- Hyperplasia (increased number of cells) — e.g., benign prostatic hyperplasia
- Hypertrophy (increased cell size) — e.g., cardiac hypertrophy in hypertension
- Atrophy (decreased cell size) — e.g., muscle atrophy with disuse
- Dysplasia (abnormal development) — e.g., cervical dysplasia (precancerous changes)
- Neoplasia (new growth) — e.g., tumours

**Inflammation and Repair**

- Acute inflammation — immediate response to injury
- Chronic inflammation — persistent inflammatory response
- Fibrosis — excessive scarring
- Granuloma formation — organized inflammatory response (TB, sarcoidosis)

**Degeneration**

- Loss of function of specialized cells
- Often irreversible
- Examples: neurodegeneration (Parkinson's), cardiac degeneration (cardiomyopathy)

**Thrombosis and Blood Coagulability**

- Thrombosis — pathological clot formation
- Related to vessel wall damage, blood stasis, or hypercoagulability (Virchow's triad)
- Can lead to infarction (tissue death from lack of blood supply)

## Part 4: Classification Systems in Practice

### The International Classification of Diseases (ICD)

The **ICD is the global standard for disease classification.** It's maintained by the WHO and currently in version 11 (ICD-11, implemented in 2022, though many countries still use ICD-10).

**Why ICD matters:**

- Provides a **common language** for comparing data across hospitals, regions, countries, and time periods
- Essential for epidemiology and public health surveillance
- Determines healthcare funding and resource allocation in many countries
- Required for diagnosis coding in medical records
- Enables research by allowing data aggregation

**What ICD does:**

- Assigns a unique alphanumeric code to each diagnosis
- Organizes diseases hierarchically (from broad categories to specific diagnoses)
- Includes not just diseases but also symptoms, injuries, health conditions

**Example ICD-11 codes:**

- BA00 — Cholera
- 8B20 — Type 2 diabetes mellitus
- CA80 — Melanoma of skin

### Cancer Staging: A Model of Comprehensive Classification

Cancer staging is an excellent example of multidimensional disease classification in practice.

**Why staging?**

- Predicts prognosis (survival likelihood)
- Guides treatment intensity and approach
- Allows comparison of outcomes between institutions
- Evolves as we learn more about cancer biology

#### The TNM System (Tumor-Node-Metastasis)

This is the standard staging system for most solid tumours.

**T — Primary Tumour**

- Describes the **size and extent** of the primary tumour
- TX: Cannot be evaluated
- T0: No evidence of primary tumour
- Tis: Carcinoma in situ (abnormal cells present but not spread — pre-invasive)
- T1, T2, T3, T4: Progressive increase in size/extent (specific measurements vary by cancer type)

**Example:** T4 might mean "tumour invades through the wall into adjacent structures" (very different from T1 "small tumour confined to tissue of origin")

**N — Regional Lymph Nodes**

- Describes **involvement of nearby lymph nodes**
- NX: Cannot be evaluated
- N0: No regional lymph node involvement
- N1, N2, N3: Progressive involvement (number of nodes and/or extent of spread varies by cancer type)

**Example:** N2 might mean "tumour spread to multiple regional nodes"

**M — Distant Metastasis**

- Describes **spread to distant organs**
- MX: Cannot be evaluated
- M0: No distant metastasis (cancer hasn't spread)
- M1: Distant metastasis present (cancer has spread)

**Example:** M1 means the patient has cancer in, say, the liver or bones (extremely serious)

**Staging Examples:**

|Stage|TNM|Prognosis|Typical Treatment|
|---|---|---|---|
|Stage I|T1-2, N0, M0|Good (often >80% 5-yr survival)|Surgery alone often sufficient|
|Stage II|T3-4, N0, M0|Intermediate|Surgery + chemotherapy/radiation|
|Stage III|Any T, N1-3, M0|Poor (often 30-50% 5-yr survival)|Multimodal therapy (surgery + chemo + radiation)|
|Stage IV|Any T, N0-3, M1|Very poor (often <20% 5-yr survival)|Palliative chemotherapy, clinical trials|

**Information gathering for staging:**

- Physical exams
- Imaging (CT, MRI, PET scans)
- Laboratory tests (tumour markers, blood work)
- Pathology reports (from biopsy or surgery)
- Surgical reports (if tissue removed)

---

## Part 5: Understanding Disease at the Population Level

### Epidemiological Concepts

Disease classification enables population-level surveillance and understanding.

**Key epidemiological terms:**

**Prevalence** — The total number of cases of disease in a population at a given time (snapshot)

- Formula: (Number of existing cases / Total population) × 100
- This is dependent on the number of people currently living with the disease
- Asks: "How many people have this disease right now?"

**Incidence** — The number of new cases of disease in a population over a defined time period

- Formula: (Number of new cases / Population at risk) × time period
- Asks: "How many new cases occurred this year?"

**Mortality** — The number of deaths from disease

- Case fatality rate (CFR): (Deaths from disease / Total cases) × 100
- Asks: "What proportion of people with this disease die from it?"

### Historical Example: Cholera and the Birth of Epidemiology

The handout references cholera, which is a perfect historical example of how understanding disease classification revolutionized public health.

**Before John Snow (1854):**

- Cholera was thought to be caused by "miasma" (bad air)
- No one understood the transmission
- Treatment was ineffective

**John Snow's approach (early epidemiology):**

- Mapped cholera deaths in London
- Discovered the Broad Street pump as the source (contaminated water)
- The germ theory of disease hadn't been formally developed yet, but Snow used epidemiological classification to identify the source

**Key lesson:** Understanding how disease spreads (classification by transmission) is as important as understanding its biological mechanism.

### Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY)

A modern measure that combines disease classification with public health impact.

**DALY = Years of life lost (YLL) + Years lived with disability (YLD)**

This measure recognizes that disease burden includes both premature death and living with illness.

**Example:**

- A 30-year-old dies from tuberculosis: significant YLL
- A 60-year-old lives 20 years with rheumatoid arthritis: significant YLD despite not dying from it
- Both represent disease burden to society

---

## Part 6: Modern Classification — Beyond Traditional Boundaries

### The Limitations of Simple Classification

Consider the case from the handout: **pneumonia caused by Haemophilus influenzae**

The question asked: "So what is the disease? The bacterium or the organ affected?"

**The answer: It's both. A good classification captures maximum information.**

Simply saying "Haemophilus infection" doesn't tell you the patient needs respiratory support or has specific complications. Simply saying "pneumonia" doesn't tell you which antibiotics will work.

**A complete classification would be:** "Community-acquired pneumonia caused by Haemophilus influenzae, lobar, with hypoxemia"

This tells you the organism (directs antibiotic choice), the location (predicts severity), and the functional impact (hypoxemia — determines ICU vs. ward admission).

### 4P Medicine: Precision, Predictive, Participatory, Preventive

Modern medicine is moving beyond categorical classification toward a more nuanced, personalized approach. The "4Ps" represent this shift:

**1. Personalised** (or Precision)

- Treatment tailored to individual patient characteristics
- Genetic/molecular profiling informs drug selection
- **Example:** EGFR mutation status determines which lung cancer patients benefit from EGFR inhibitors

**2. Predictive**

- Using biomarkers and risk factors to predict disease before it develops
- Identifying susceptibility in asymptomatic individuals
- **Example:** BRCA1/2 mutation carriers have ~70% lifetime risk of breast cancer; can pursue preventive screening or surgery

**3. Participatory**

- Involving patients in decision-making about their care
- Shared decision-making about treatment options
- Recognizing patient preferences and values
- **Example:** A patient with early-stage breast cancer participates in choosing between surgery alone vs. surgery + radiation based on preferences about survival vs. treatment burden

**4. Preventive**

- Prevention rather than just treatment
- Identifying modifiable risk factors
- Lifestyle and environmental interventions
- **Example:** Identifying someone with metabolic syndrome and helping them lose weight, exercise, and eat better to prevent type 2 diabetes

### Stratified Medicine

A related concept that emphasizes **grouping patients into subgroups based on genetic, biomarker, phenotypic, or psychosocial characteristics** to tailor treatment.

**Example:** Cancer treatment based on specific mutations:

- BRAF mutation carriers with melanoma → BRAF inhibitors
- PD-L1 high tumours → immune checkpoint inhibitors
- BRCA-deficient tumours → PARP inhibitors

**Same diagnosis (melanoma), completely different treatment based on stratification.**

---

## Part 7: Case Studies — Putting It All Together

### Case 1: Ovarian Cancer

A 55-year-old woman presents with abdominal bloating and pain. Imaging shows a large ovarian mass. Biopsy confirms adenocarcinoma.

**Traditional classification:** "Ovarian adenocarcinoma"

**Modern stratified classification might include:**

- Histological subtype (high-grade serous, clear cell, endometrioid, mucinous) — each has different prognosis and treatment
- Stage (I-IV based on TNM) — predicts survival
- BRCA mutation status — predicts response to platinum-based chemotherapy and PARP inhibitors
- HRD (homologous recombination deficiency) score — predicts PARP inhibitor benefit
- TP53 mutation status — prognostic value
- Platinum sensitivity — predicts response to retreatment

**Treatment implications:**

- BRCA-mutated + platinum-sensitive → chemotherapy + PARP inhibitor maintenance (significantly improves survival)
- BRCA wild-type, HRD-positive + platinum-sensitive → chemotherapy + PARP inhibitor
- BRCA wild-type, HRD-negative → chemotherapy alone

**Same diagnosis. Four different treatment pathways based on modern classification.**

---

## Key Points to Remember

1. **Disease classification is not purely objective.** Culture, values, and social context matter as much as biology.
    
2. **Simple classification is insufficient.** A diagnosis is only the starting point; full classification requires anatomical, functional, biological, and increasingly genomic information.
    
3. **The same aetiology produces different outcomes, and the same outcome has multiple aetiologies.** Never assume causation based on diagnosis alone.
    
4. **Classification serves multiple purposes:** communication, prognosis, treatment selection, prediction, and epidemiology. Different classification systems work for different purposes.
    
5. **Modern medicine is moving toward personalization.** The TNM system and ICD coding remain important, but 4P medicine emphasizes the individual patient's unique biological and social circumstances.
    
6. **Always ask yourself:** "Is this classification giving me enough information to predict prognosis and guide treatment?" If not, dig deeper.

## Self-Check Questions

1. What's the difference between aetiology and pathogenesis?
2. Why isn't "pneumonia" enough information for treatment decisions?
3. What are the four main classification approaches, and when would you use each?
4. How does TNM staging differ from simple anatomical classification?
5. What's an idiopathic disease? Why is it frustrating for clinicians?
6. How does 4P medicine change the way we think about classification?
7. Why does the same cause sometimes produce different diseases? Give an example.

## Summary##
- A patient should not be labelled by the disease but rather the patient has the disease
- More information need to be provided
	- The disease could lead to other symptoms and effect of the body. It can cause a condition.
	- Term is useful when understanding what the disease does, not the whole story though
- The patient is living with, not dying from, the classification of the disease
	- Personalisation of the person
- Look at the cause of the disease (aetiology) rather than only the surface level of the disease.
	- Cardiovascular disease - due to diabetes, tackle the root of the problem
- The cause doesn't always result in the disease
