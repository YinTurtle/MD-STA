also known as the alimentary canal


Externally facing system. 
## OVERVIEW: Primary Functions

**PRIMARY FUNCTION:** Absorption of nutrients

**DIGESTION:** Breaks down complex food molecules to aid absorption

- **Physical (Mechanical):** Chewing, churning, mixing
- **Chemical:** Enzymes, acid, bile

**SIX KEY PROCESSES:**

1. **Motility** - Movement of food through tract
2. **Secretion** - Release of enzymes, acid, mucus, bile
3. **Digestion** - Breaking down macromolecules
4. **Absorption** - Uptake of nutrients into bloodstream (mostly occurs in the small intestines)
5. Storage - e.g. stomach store food before digestion
6. Excretion - defecation at the anus after 'storing', before giving a sense of urgency

## BLOOD SUPPLY TO THE GUT

### **Three Major Arteries:**

1. **COELIAC ARTERY**
    - Supplies: Liver, pancreas, stomach
    
2. **SUPERIOR MESENTERIC ARTERY**
    - Supplies: Small intestine + most of large intestine
    
3. **INFERIOR MESENTERIC ARTERY**
    - Supplies: Terminal portions of large intestine + rectum

### **Blood Flow Regulation:**

**Autonomic Nervous System:**

- Parasympathetic → **vasodilation** (increases blood flow)
- Sympathetic → **vasoconstriction** (decreases blood flow)
- Enteric → **vasodilation**

**Hormonal (Endocrine) Control:**

- Adrenaline/Epinephrine → vasoconstriction
- Gastrin → **vasodilation**

**Local (Paracrine) Control:**

- Low pO₂ (low oxygen) → **vasodilation**

**Clinical Pearl:** After eating, blood flow to GI tract increases dramatically (up to 30% of cardiac output) - this is why you feel sleepy after a big meal!

## MICROANATOMY OF GIT: Four Main Layers

Think of the GIT as a tube with four concentric layers, each with specific jobs:

### **1. MUCOSA** (Innermost Layer)

**Three Components:**

**a) Epithelium:**

- Lines the lumen (inside space)
- Varies along GIT depending on function
- Mouth/esophagus: stratified squamous (protection from abrasion)
- Stomach/intestines: simple columnar (secretion and absorption)

**b) Lamina Propria:**

- Loose connective tissue
- Contains blood vessels, lymphatics
- Contains GALT (Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue) - immune surveillance

**c) Muscularis Mucosa:**

- Thin smooth muscle layer
- Creates folds to increase surface area
- Allows local movement independent of whole gut

### **2. SUBMUCOSA**

**Structure:**

- Dense connective tissue
- Contains larger blood vessels
- Contains **Meissner's (Submucosal) Plexus** - nerve network

**Meissner's Plexus Function:**

- Part of **Enteric Nervous System**
- Regulates intestinal **secretions**
- Regulates area-specific **absorption**
- Interacts with blood vessels and muscle layers

**Analogy:** Think of submucosa as the "infrastructure layer" - the plumbing and wiring that keeps everything running

### **3. MUSCULARIS EXTERNA** (Muscle Layer)

**Two Smooth Muscle Layers:**

**a) Inner Circular Muscle:**

- Fibers run around the circumference
- Contraction narrows the lumen
- Creates segmentation (mixing movements)

**b) Outer Longitudinal Muscle:**

- Fibers run along the length
- Contraction shortens the tube
- Creates peristalsis (propulsive movements)

**Between These Layers: Myenteric (Auerbach's) Plexus:**

- Part of **Enteric Nervous System**
- Regulates intestinal **smooth muscle**
- Generates tonic and rhythmic contractions
- Controls **motility**

**Key Concept:** The two muscle layers work together like squeezing a toothpaste tube - circular muscle squeezes, longitudinal muscle shortens, creating waves of contraction

### **4. SEROSA** (Outermost Layer)

**Structure:**

- Connective tissue
- Squamous epithelial cells (peritoneum)
- Secretes serous fluid

**Function:**

- Reduces friction as organs move against each other
- Part of peritoneal cavity

**Note:** In some areas (like esophagus), this is called **adventitia** instead of serosa

![[Pasted image 20251015122730.png|600]]
![[Pasted image 20251015123034.png|500]]
The oblique layer of smooth muscle in the stomach helps with churning and mixing the food with digestive enzymes, physically breaking it down into a semi-liquid substance called chyme.

---

## STRUCTURE-FUNCTION RELATIONSHIP

**Key Principle:** Different layers become more prominent depending on location and main function

**Examples:**

- **Esophagus:** Thick muscularis externa (needs strong peristalsis)
- **Stomach:** Thick mucosa with deep gastric glands (secretion)
- **Small intestine:** Extensive mucosa with villi (absorption)
- **Large intestine:** Prominent muscularis externa (propulsion)

---

## AUTONOMIC REGULATION: Three Nervous Systems

The GI tract is unique - it has **THREE** nervous system divisions controlling it:
- Parasympathetic (PSNS)
- Sympathetic (SNS)
- Enteric (ENS)

### **1. PARASYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM (PSNS)**

**Innervation:**

- **Vagus nerve** (cranial nerve X) from medulla oblongata
    - Supplies: Esophagus → transverse colon
- **Pelvic splanchnic nerves** (S2-S4)
    - Supplies: Descending colon → rectum

**Components:**

- Has both **sensory** and **motor** fibers
- Responds to: Stretch, pressure, temperature, osmolarity

**Primary Neurotransmitters:**

- **Acetylcholine (ACh)** - main one
- Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP)
- Gastric-releasing peptide
- Substance P

**Function:** **"REST AND DIGEST"**

- **Stimulates** GI secretions
- **Stimulates** GI motility
- **Increases** blood flow
- Facilitates digestion and absorption

**Clinical:** Vagal nerve stimulation during medical procedures can cause bradycardia and hypotension (vasovagal response)

![[Pasted image 20251015123525.png]]

### **2. SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM (SNS)**

**Origin:**

- Thoracic (T5-T12) and Lumbar (L1-L3) spinal cord

**Synapse in Four Ganglia:**

1. **Superior cervical ganglion** - upper GI tract
2. **Celiac ganglion** - stomach, liver, pancreas
3. **Superior mesenteric ganglion** - small intestine, proximal colon
4. **Inferior mesenteric ganglion** - distal colon, rectum

**Primary Neurotransmitters:**

- **Noradrenaline/Norepinephrine** - main one
- Neuropeptide Y

**Function:** **"FIGHT OR FLIGHT"**

- **Decreases** GI secretions
- **Decreases** GI motility
- **Decreases** blood flow (vasoconstriction)
- Diverts blood to skeletal muscles and heart

**Analogy:** When you're running from danger, your body says "we'll digest that lunch later" and shuts down the GI tract to prioritize survival

**Clinical:** This is why acute stress can cause constipation or why you don't feel hungry when anxious

![[Pasted image 20251015123743.png]]

### **3. ENTERIC NERVOUS SYSTEM (ENS)**

**"The Brain in the Gut"** - Contains ~500 million neurons (more than spinal cord!)

**Two Main Plexuses:**

**a) Submucosal (Meissner's) Plexus:**

- Location: In submucosa
- Functions:
    - Regulates intestinal **secretions**
    - Regulates area-specific **absorption**
    - Interacts with blood vessels
    - Interacts with muscle layers

**b) Myenteric (Auerbach's) Plexus:**

- Location: Between circular and longitudinal muscle
- Functions:
    - Regulates smooth muscle
    - Generates tonic contractions
    - Generates rhythmic contractions
    - Controls **motility patterns**

**Primary Neurotransmitters:**

- **Acetylcholine (ACh)**
- **Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP)**
- **Substance P**
- **Nitric oxide (NO)**
- **5-HT (Serotonin)**
- **Enkephalins**

**CRITICAL FEATURE:** ENS can **function autonomously**

- If you cut PSNS and SNS fibers, ENS still works!
- Has intrinsic neural and sensory reflexes
- Can coordinate local responses without brain input

**Clinical Correlations:**

- **Hirschsprung's disease:** Absent ENS neurons in distal colon → severe constipation
- **Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS):** May involve ENS dysfunction
- ~95% of body's serotonin is in the gut (ENS) - this is why SSRIs can cause GI side effects

**Analogy:** Think of ENS as a local factory manager who can make day-to-day decisions without calling corporate headquarters (brain), but headquarters can still override when needed

---

## DIGESTIVE PHASES: Neurohumoral Regulation

Digestion is coordinated in **three phases** - like a relay race where one phase triggers the next:

### **PHASE 1: CEPHALIC PHASE** ("Head Phase")

**Trigger:** Before food even enters mouth

- Sight of food
- Smell of food
- Thought of food
- Taste of food

**Pathway:** **Vagal (parasympathetic) pathways**

**Effects:**

- Increases salivation
- Increases gastric acid secretion
- Increases gastric motility
- "Primes" the stomach for incoming food

**Clinical:** This is why your mouth waters when you smell fresh bread - your vagus nerve is preparing your GI tract

**Analogy:** Like warming up your car engine before driving - getting everything ready before the main event

### **PHASE 2: GASTRIC PHASE** ("Stomach Phase")

**Trigger:** Food enters stomach

**Two Main Mechanisms:**

**a) Mechanical (Distention):**

- Stretching of stomach wall
- Activates stretch receptors
- Triggers vagal-cholinergic reflexes
- Stimulates acid and pepsinogen secretion

**b) Chemical (Gastrin Release):**

- Proteins and amino acids in stomach
- Stimulate **G cells** to release **gastrin**
- Gastrin increases:
    - Gastric acid secretion
    - Gastric motility
    - Growth of gastric mucosa

**Pathway:** **Vagal-cholinergic** + **Gastrin (endocrine)**

**Clinical:** Gastrin-secreting tumors (gastrinomas) cause Zollinger-Ellison syndrome - massive acid production → severe peptic ulcers

### **PHASE 3: INTESTINAL PHASE** ("Small Intestine Phase")

**Trigger:** Chyme enters duodenum

**Two Main Hormones Released:**

**a) CCK (Cholecystokinin):**

- **Stimulus:** Amino acids and fatty acids in duodenum
- **Source:** **I cells** in duodenum
- **Effects:**
    - Stimulates pancreatic enzyme secretion
    - Stimulates gallbladder contraction (releases bile)
    - Slows gastric emptying (negative feedback)
    - Triggers **vagovagal enteropancreatic reflex** → stimulates pancreatic acinar cells

**b) Secretin:**

- **Stimulus:** H⁺ (acid) in duodenum
- **Source:** **S cells** in duodenum
- **Effects:**
    - Stimulates pancreatic bicarbonate secretion (neutralizes acid)
    - Inhibits gastric acid secretion
    - Slows gastric emptying

**Key Concept:** The intestinal phase provides **negative feedback** - it slows down stomach emptying to prevent overwhelming the small intestine

**Analogy:** Like a traffic light system - when the duodenum detects too much chyme coming through, it signals the stomach to "slow down, we're backed up here"

![[Pasted image 20251015124307.png]]
---

## UPPER GI TRACT

**Components:** Mouth, Esophagus, Stomach

**Key Features:**

- **Minimal** role in nutrient absorption
- Mainly **transport** and **preparation** of food
- Breaking into smaller pieces
- Hydrating food for enzymatic action
- Beginning chemical digestion

---

## MOUTH

### **Teeth:**

**32 Permanent Adult Teeth:**

- **Incisors** (8) - cut food
- **Canines** (4) - tear and pierce
- **Premolars** (8) - grind
- **Molars** (12) - grind and crush

**Jaw Muscles:**

- Provide force and movement
- **Masseter** and **temporalis** - most powerful
- Can generate ~500N of force

### **Tongue:**

**Functions:**

- Repositions food during chewing
- Contains taste receptors (taste buds)
- Initiates swallowing
- Speech articulation

### **Mastication (Chewing):**

**Type:** Both **voluntary** and **reflex** behavior

**Functions:**

1. **Increase surface area** - helps with digestion
2. **Mix food** with saliva and amylase
3. Form **bolus** (ball of food ready to swallow)

**Clinical:** Poor dentition in elderly → inadequate chewing → malnutrition risk

---

## SALIVARY GLANDS

### **Three Paired Glands:**

**1. PAROTID:**

- Location: In cheeks beside ear
- Secretion: **Watery** (serous)
- Largest salivary gland

**2. SUBMANDIBULAR:**

- Location: Under jaw
- Secretion: **Watery** (mixed serous and mucous)
- Produces ~70% of saliva at rest

**3. SUBLINGUAL:**

- Location: Floor of mouth
- Secretion: **Mucous** (thick, viscous)
- Smallest gland

### **Functions of Saliva:**

**1. Lubrication:**

- Mucus helps form bolus
- Eases swallowing

**2. Protection:**

- **Lysozyme** - antibacterial enzyme
- **IgA** - antibodies
- **Calcium salts** - tooth remineralization
- Buffering capacity (bicarbonate)

**3. Digestion:**

- **Salivary amylase** (ptyalin) - breaks down starch
- Begins carbohydrate digestion
- Works at neutral pH

**4. Taste:**

- Dissolves food particles
- Allows taste receptors to detect chemicals

**Production:** ~1-1.5 liters per day

**Clinical Correlations:**

- **Xerostomia** (dry mouth) → difficulty swallowing, increased dental caries
- **Sjögren's syndrome** → autoimmune destruction of salivary glands
- **Mumps** → viral infection of parotid glands

![[Pasted image 20251015125015.png]]
---

## PHARYNX AND OESOPHAGUS

### **Pharynx:**

- Shared passageway for food and air
- Swallowing reflex closes off airway (epiglottis)

### **Oesophagus:**

**Structure:**

- Muscular tube ~25 cm long
- Connects pharynx to stomach
- Passes through diaphragm at **esophageal hiatus**

**Muscle Layers:**

- **Upper 1/3:** Skeletal (striated) muscle - voluntary control
- **Middle 1/3:** Mixed
- **Lower 1/3:** Smooth muscle - involuntary

**Two Sphincters:**

**1. Upper Esophageal Sphincter (UES):**

- Skeletal muscle
- Prevents air entering esophagus during breathing
- Relaxes during swallowing

**2. Lower Esophageal Sphincter (LES):**

- Smooth muscle (physiological sphincter - no anatomical thickening)
- Prevents reflux of gastric contents
- Relaxes when food approaches

**Function:** **Transport only** - no digestion or absorption

**Peristalsis in Esophagus:**

- **Primary peristalsis:** Initiated by swallowing (vagal control)
- **Secondary peristalsis:** Initiated by distention (ENS control)
- Speed: ~4 cm/second
- Takes ~9 seconds for food to reach stomach

**Clinical Correlations:**

- **GERD** (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease) → LES dysfunction
- **Achalasia** → failure of LES to relax → dysphagia
- **Barrett's esophagus** → chronic GERD → metaplasia → cancer risk

![[Pasted image 20251015125314.png]]
---

## STOMACH

### **Functions:**

1. **Storage reservoir** for food
2. **Mechanical digestion** (mixing)
3. **Chemical digestion** (acid, pepsin)
4. **Production of chyme** (semi-liquid material)
5. **Intrinsic factor secretion** (for B12 absorption)
6. **Some absorption** (alcohol, aspirin, water)

### **Three Primary Motility Functions:**

**1. ACCOMMODATION:**

- **Receptive relaxation** - stomach relaxes to accept food
- Can expand from ~50 ml to 1.5 liters without increasing pressure
- Mediated by **vagus nerve** and **nitric oxide**

**Analogy:** Like a balloon that expands without increasing internal pressure - it accommodates volume

**2. MIXING:**

- **Slow waves** (electrical rhythm) initiate contractions
- Frequency: ~3 contractions per minute
- **Retropulsion** - contents pushed toward pylorus then back
- Creates churning motion
- Breaks down food particles
- Mixes with gastric secretions

**Analogy:** Like a washing machine - churning back and forth to mix everything thoroughly

**3. GASTRIC EMPTYING:**

- Liquid empties faster than solids
- Small particles (<1-2 mm) can pass through pylorus
- Regulated by:
    - Stomach distention (increases emptying)
    - Duodenal feedback (decreases emptying)
    - Osmolarity, acidity, fat content (all decrease emptying)

**Half-emptying times:**

- Liquids: ~30 minutes
- Solids: ~3 hours

### **Between Meals: Migrating Motor Complexes (MMCs)**

**What:** Waves of intense contractions

**When:** Every 90-120 minutes during fasting

**Function:**

- **Prevent bacterial overgrowth**
- **"Housekeeping"** - sweep undigested material and bacteria into small intestine
- Keep stomach and intestine clean

**Stimulated by:** **Motilin** (hormone)

**Clinical:** MMCs cause the "stomach growling" (borborygmi) you hear when hungry

**Stopped by:** Eating (switches to fed pattern)

![[Pasted image 20251015125534.png]]

---

## GASTRIC SECRETIONS

### **What the Stomach Secretes:**

**1. Ions and Water:**

- H⁺ (acid)
- Cl⁻
- K⁺
- Na⁺
- Water

**2. Mucus:**

- From **mucous neck cells**
- Forms protective barrier
- Bicarbonate trapped in mucus layer

**3. Pepsinogen:**

- From **peptic (chief) cells**
- Inactive enzyme precursor
- Converted to **pepsin** by acid

**4. Gastric Lipase:**

- From **peptic (chief) cells**
- Digests fats (minor role)

**5. Intrinsic Factor:**

- From **parietal (oxyntic) cells**
- **Essential** for vitamin B12 absorption in ileum

**6. H⁺ (Acid):**

- From **parietal (oxyntic) cells**
- Via **H⁺-K⁺ ATPase** (proton pump)

### **Regulation of H⁺ (Acid) Secretion:**

**Primary Control Point:** **H⁺-K⁺ ATPase** on parietal cells

**THREE Stimulants of Acid Secretion:**

**1. Acetylcholine (ACh):**

- Source: Parasympathetic **nerves** (vagus)
- Receptor: M3 (muscarinic)

**2. Gastrin:**

- Source: **G cells** in stomach antrum
- Receptor: CCK-B receptor
- Released by: Proteins, amino acids, stomach distention

**3. Histamine:**

- Source: **Enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells** in stomach
- Receptor: H2 receptor
- Strongest stimulant

**Analogy:** Think of these three as a "triangle of stimulation" - all three work together synergistically (effect together > sum of individual effects)

**TWO Main Inhibitors:**

**1. Somatostatin:**

- Source: **D cells** in stomach
- Inhibits G cells (decreases gastrin)
- Inhibits parietal cells directly
- Released by: Acid (negative feedback)

**2. Prostaglandins:**

- Decrease acid secretion
- Increase mucus and bicarbonate
- Increase blood flow
- Protective effect

**Clinical Applications:**

**Drugs that Decrease Acid:**

- **H2 blockers** (e.g., ranitidine) - block histamine H2 receptors
- **Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)** (e.g., omeprazole) - block H⁺-K⁺ ATPase directly
- **Antacids** - neutralize acid

**Drugs that Increase Risk of Ulcers:**

- **NSAIDs** (e.g., ibuprofen) - decrease prostaglandins → less protection

**Disease States:**

- **Pernicious anemia** - autoimmune destruction of parietal cells → no intrinsic factor → can't absorb B12
- **Zollinger-Ellison syndrome** - gastrin-secreting tumor → massive acid production

**Why Stomach Doesn't Digest Itself:**

1. **Mucus-bicarbonate barrier**
2. **Tight junctions** between epithelial cells
3. **Rapid cell turnover** (epithelium replaced every 3-5 days)
4. **Good blood flow** (removes back-diffused acid)

![[Pasted image 20251015125556.png]]
---

## LOWER GI TRACT - SMALL INTESTINE

### **Three Sections:**

1. **Duodenum** (~25 cm) - receives bile and pancreatic secretions
2. **Jejunum** (~2.5 m) - main site of nutrient absorption
3. **Ileum** (~3.5 m) - continues absorption, B12 absorption

**Total length:** ~6-7 meters

### **Primary Function: ABSORPTION**

**MOST** macronutrient, vitamin, and mineral absorption occurs here

### **Surface Area Amplification:**

Think of this as "architecture for absorption" - three levels of folding:

**1. Circular Folds (Plicae Circulares):**

- Permanent folds
- Increase surface area ~3-fold

**2. Villi:**

- Finger-like projections (0.5-1 mm tall)
- Increase surface area ~10-fold
- Each villus contains:
    - Capillary network (for water-soluble nutrients)
    - Lacteal (lymphatic vessel for fat)
    - Smooth muscle for movement

**3. Microvilli:**

- Hair-like projections on epithelial cells
- Form "brush border"
- Increase surface area ~20-fold
- Contain digestive enzymes

**Total Surface Area:** ~200 m² (size of tennis court!)

**Analogy:** Like a towel - flat it's small, but all those fibers and loops create massive surface area for absorption

![[Pasted image 20251015121831.png]]
---

## SMALL INTESTINE MOTILITY

### **Two Main Types:**

**1. SEGMENTATION:** **Function:** **Mixing**

**Mechanism:**

- Circular muscle contracts in alternating segments
- Creates "sausage-like" compartments
- Contents moved back and forth
- Doesn't propel forward much

**Purpose:**

- Mix chyme with secretions
- Bring nutrients in contact with mucosa
- Maximize absorption

**Frequency:** ~12 contractions/minute in duodenum, ~8/minute in ileum

**Analogy:** Like kneading bread dough - mixing but not moving forward

**2. PERISTALSIS:** **Function:** **Propulsion**

**Mechanism:**

- Wave of contraction
- Circular muscle contracts behind bolus (narrows)
- Longitudinal muscle contracts ahead of bolus (shortens)
- Pushes contents along

**Speed:** Slow - takes 3-5 hours to traverse small intestine

**Purpose:**

- Move chyme along tract
- Allows time for digestion and absorption

### **Between Meals: Migrating Motor Complexes (MMCs)**

Same as in stomach:

- Intense contractions every 90-120 minutes
- **Prevent bacterial overgrowth**
- **Prevent reflux** of bacteria from large intestine back to terminal ileum
- The **ileocecal valve** is important barrier

---

## DIGESTION AND ABSORPTION IN SMALL INTESTINE

### **CARBOHYDRATE DIGESTION:**

**Stage 1 - Mouth:**

- **Salivary amylase** begins starch breakdown
- Stops working in stomach (acid denatures it)

**Stage 2 - Small Intestine (MAIN SITE):**

- **Pancreatic amylase** breaks down starch → disaccharides
- **Brush border enzymes** (membrane-bound):
    - **Maltase** - maltose → 2 glucose
    - **Sucrase** - sucrose → glucose + fructose
    - **Lactase** - lactose → glucose + galactose

**Absorption:**

- Via **sodium-dependent cotransport** (secondary active transport)
- **SGLT1** transporter in apical membrane
- Glucose and galactose: SGLT1
- Fructose: GLUT5 (facilitated diffusion)
- Exit to blood: GLUT2 (basolateral membrane)

**Clinical:**

- **Lactose intolerance** - lactase deficiency → undigested lactose → osmotic diarrhea + bacterial fermentation → gas, bloating

### **PROTEIN DIGESTION:**

**Stage 1 - Stomach:**

- **Pepsin** begins protein breakdown
- Works best in acidic pH
- Breaks proteins into smaller polypeptides

**Stage 2 - Small Intestine (MAIN SITE):**

- **Pancreatic enzymes:**
    - **Trypsin** - breaks specific peptide bonds
    - **Chymotrypsin** - breaks different peptide bonds
    - **Elastase** - breaks elastin
    - **Carboxypeptidase** - removes amino acids from C-terminus
- **Brush border peptidases:**
    - Break small peptides into amino acids

**Absorption:**

- Via **sodium-dependent cotransport** (like glucose)
- Via **H⁺-dependent cotransport**
- Different transporters for different amino acid groups
- Can also absorb small di- and tripeptides

**Clinical:** Protein malabsorption → muscle wasting, hypoalbuminemia, edema

### **LIPID DIGESTION:**

**Stage 1 - Mouth and Stomach:**

- **Lingual lipase** (mouth)
- **Gastric lipase** (stomach)
- Minor role (~10-30% of fat digestion)

**Stage 2 - Small Intestine (MAIN SITE):**

**Problem:** Fats are hydrophobic, enzymes are water-soluble

**Solution:** **EMULSIFICATION** by bile salts

**Steps:**

**1. Emulsification:**

- **Bile salts** from liver/gallbladder
- Break large fat droplets into smaller droplets
- Increase surface area for enzyme action

**Analogy:** Like dish soap breaking up grease - creates tiny droplets that mix with water

**2. Digestion:**

- **Pancreatic lipase** breaks triglycerides
- Products: 2 fatty acids + 1 monoglyceride
- **Colipase** helps lipase work in presence of bile

**3. Micelle Formation:**

- Bile salts form **micelles** (tiny packages)
- Contain: Fatty acids, monoglycerides, cholesterol, fat-soluble vitamins
- Transport to brush border

**4. Absorption:**

- Lipids leave micelle and diffuse across membrane
- Inside cell: Re-esterified into triglycerides
- Packaged into **chylomicrons** (large lipoproteins)
- Exit via **lacteal** (lymphatic system) not blood!

**5. Bile Salt Recycling:**

- ~95% of bile salts reabsorbed in **terminal ileum**
- Return to liver via blood
- **Enterohepatic circulation**

**Clinical Correlations:**

- **Steatorrhea** (fatty stools) - seen in:
    - Pancreatic insufficiency (no lipase)
    - Bile duct obstruction (no bile salts)
    - Ileal disease (can't reabsorb bile salts)
- **Fat-soluble vitamin deficiency** (A, D, E, K) - same causes as steatorrhea
- **Orlistat** (weight-loss drug) - inhibits pancreatic lipase → fat malabsorption

---

## LOWER GI TRACT - LARGE INTESTINE

### **Sections:**

1. **Caecum** - receives contents from ileum
2. **Ascending colon** - right side, goes up
3. **Transverse colon** - crosses abdomen
4. **Descending colon** - left side, goes down
5. **Sigmoid colon** - S-shaped
6. **Rectum** - storage before defecation
7. **Anus** - exit

**Length:** ~1.5 meters

### **Main Functions:**

**1. Water and Electrolyte Absorption:**

- **PRIMARY FUNCTION**
- Absorbs ~1-2 liters of water per day
- Converts liquid chyme to solid feces
- Absorbs Na⁺, Cl⁻
- Secretes K⁺, HCO₃⁻

**2. Storage:**

- Temporary storage of feces

**3. Bacterial Fermentation:**

- Contains ~10¹⁴ bacteria (more than cells in body!)
- Ferment undigested carbohydrates
- Produce short-chain fatty acids (energy for colonocytes)
- Produce vitamin K and some B vitamins
- Produce gas (H₂, CO₂, CH₄)

**Clinical:** Antibiotics kill gut flora → diarrhea, C. difficile overgrowth

---

## LARGE INTESTINE MOTILITY

### **Three Types of Movement:**

**1. SEGMENTATION (Haustral Contractions):**

- **Function:** Mixing
- Creates "haustra" (pouches)
- Slow, back-and-forth movement
- Allows time for water absorption

**2. PERISTALSIS:**

- **Function:** Propulsion
- Relatively **weak** compared to small intestine
- Slow movement (takes 12-24 hours)

**3. MASS MOVEMENT CONTRACTIONS:**

- **Function:** Major propulsion
- Strong contractions
- Move contents long distances
- Occur 1-3 times per day
- Often triggered by:
    - Eating (gastrocolic reflex)
    - Morning awakening
- Push contents into rectum → urge to defecate

**Analogy:** Mass movements are like a snow plow - periodically clearing everything out in one big push
![[Pasted image 20251015130020.png]]

---

## DEFECATION

### **Anatomy:**

**Two Sphincters:**

**1. Internal Anal Sphincter:**

- **Smooth muscle** (involuntary)
- Normally contracted (closed)
- Controlled by ANS

**2. External Anal Sphincter:**

- **Skeletal (striated) muscle** (voluntary)
- Under conscious control
- Can override reflexes

### **Rectosphincteric Reflex:**

**Trigger:** Feces or gas in rectum stretches rectal wall

**Response:**

1. Stretch receptors activated
2. **Internal sphincter RELAXES** (involuntary)
3. **External sphincter CONTRACTS** (voluntary)
4. You become aware of need to defecate
5. If socially appropriate:
    - You **voluntarily relax** external sphincter
    - Abdominal muscles contract (Valsalva maneuver)
    - Defecation occurs
6. If not appropriate:
    - You keep external sphincter contracted
    - Rectum relaxes (accommodates)
    - Urge temporarily subsides

**Clinical Correlations:**

- **Spinal cord injury:** Loss of voluntary control → fecal incontinence
- **Hirschsprung's disease:** Absent ENS neurons → rectum can't relax → severe constipation
- **Chronic constipation:** Ignoring defecation urge → desensitization of rectal stretch receptors → harder to initiate defecation

- **Hemorrhoids:** Straining during defecation → venous engorgement
- **Fecal incontinence:** Damage to external sphincter (e.g., during childbirth) → loss of voluntary control

## INTEGRATION: HOW IT ALL WORKS TOGETHER

### **After You Eat a Meal:**

**1. CEPHALIC PHASE (0-5 minutes):**

- See/smell food
- Vagus nerve activated
- Saliva production increases
- Gastric acid secretion begins
- "Getting ready"

**2. Chewing and Swallowing (0-10 seconds):**

- Mastication increases surface area
- Salivary amylase begins starch digestion
- Bolus formed
- Swallowing reflex triggered
- Peristalsis moves food down esophagus (~9 seconds)

**3. GASTRIC PHASE (0-4 hours):**

- Food enters stomach
- Receptive relaxation (accommodation)
- Distention triggers:
    - Vagal reflexes → more acid
    - Gastrin release → more acid
- Mixing (retropulsion) creates chyme
- Pepsin begins protein digestion
- Gastric emptying regulated by:
    - Stomach distention (speeds it up)
    - Duodenal feedback (slows it down)

**4. INTESTINAL PHASE (2-6 hours):**

- Chyme enters duodenum
- Acid triggers **secretin** release → pancreatic bicarbonate
- Fats/proteins trigger **CCK** release → pancreatic enzymes, gallbladder contraction
- Negative feedback slows gastric emptying
- **Duodenum:** Neutralization, enzyme mixing
- **Jejunum:** Main absorption site
    - Carbohydrates → glucose, fructose, galactose
    - Proteins → amino acids, small peptides
    - Fats → fatty acids, monoglycerides (via micelles → chylomicrons)
    - Vitamins, minerals absorbed
- **Ileum:**
    - Continues absorption
    - B12 + intrinsic factor absorbed
    - Bile salts reabsorbed (enterohepatic circulation)

**5. LARGE INTESTINE (12-24 hours):**

- Water absorption (1-2 liters/day)
- Bacterial fermentation
- Storage
- Mass movements → rectum
- Defecation reflex

**Total Transit Time:** ~24-72 hours (mouth to anus)

## AUTONOMIC INTEGRATION SUMMARY

Think of the three nervous systems as a hierarchy:

**Brain (CNS):**

- Overall coordination
- Can override local reflexes
- Emotional state affects GI function

↓

**PARASYMPATHETIC (Vagus + Pelvic Splanchnic):**

- "Command from headquarters"
- Rest and digest
- Stimulates secretion and motility

↓

**SYMPATHETIC (Thoracolumbar):**

- "Emergency override"
- Fight or flight
- Inhibits secretion and motility
- Diverts blood away from gut

↓

**ENTERIC NERVOUS SYSTEM:**

- "Local management"
- Can function independently
- Coordinates local reflexes
- Modulated by PSNS and SNS

**Clinical Example - Stress Response:**

1. See stressful situation
2. SNS activated
3. Blood diverted from gut → skeletal muscle
4. GI motility decreases
5. Sphincters contract
6. You feel "butterflies" or nausea
7. Not a good time to eat!

**Clinical Example - Relaxed Meal:**

1. Peaceful environment
2. PSNS dominant
3. Blood flow to gut increases
4. Secretions increase
5. Motility increases
6. Optimal digestion and absorption
7. You feel sleepy after big meal (blood to gut, not brain)

## ENZYMES SUMMARY - WHERE AND WHAT

### **MOUTH:**

- **Salivary amylase** - starch → maltose

### **STOMACH:**

- **Pepsin** - proteins → polypeptides
- **Gastric lipase** - fats (minor role)

### **PANCREAS (into duodenum):**

**For Carbohydrates:**

- **Pancreatic amylase** - starch → maltose, maltotriose

**For Proteins:**

- **Trypsin** - proteins → peptides
- **Chymotrypsin** - proteins → peptides
- **Elastase** - elastin → peptides
- **Carboxypeptidase** - peptides → amino acids

**For Fats:**

- **Pancreatic lipase** - triglycerides → fatty acids + monoglycerides

- **Cholesterol esterase** - cholesterol esters → cholesterol

### **BRUSH BORDER (Small Intestine):**

**For Carbohydrates:**

- **Maltase** - maltose → glucose + glucose
- **Sucrase** - sucrose → glucose + fructose
- **Lactase** - lactose → glucose + galactose
- **Isomaltase** - isomaltose → glucose + glucose

**For Proteins:**

- **Aminopeptidases** - remove amino acids from N-terminus
- **Dipeptidases** - dipeptides → amino acids

## COMMON STUDENT CONFUSIONS - CLARIFIED

### **1. "Why doesn't the stomach digest itself?"**

**Four protective mechanisms:**

1. **Mucus-bicarbonate layer** - physical and chemical barrier
2. **Tight junctions** - prevent acid penetrating between cells
3. **Prostaglandins** - maintain blood flow and mucus production
4. **Rapid turnover** - epithelium replaced every 3-5 days

**When this fails:** Peptic ulcer disease

- H. pylori infection damages mucus layer
- NSAIDs decrease prostaglandins → less protection
- Stress increases acid, decreases blood flow

### **2. "What's the difference between segmentation and peristalsis?"**

**SEGMENTATION:**

- **Purpose:** Mixing
- **Pattern:** Alternating contractions (looks like sausage links)
- **Movement:** Back and forth, minimal forward movement
- **Where:** Mainly small intestine during digestion
- **Analogy:** Washing machine

**PERISTALSIS:**

- **Purpose:** Propulsion
- **Pattern:** Wave of contraction moving in one direction
- **Movement:** Forward progression
- **Where:** Entire GI tract
- **Analogy:** Squeezing toothpaste tube

### **3. "Why do fats go to lymph instead of blood?"**

**Answer:** Chylomicrons are TOO BIG for capillaries!

- Chylomicrons = 75-1200 nm diameter
- Capillary pores = ~6 nm
- Lymphatic vessels have larger openings
- Lymph eventually drains into blood via thoracic duct

**Clinical:** This is why you can't give fat emulsions intravenously too quickly - risk of fat embolism

### **4. "What's the point of bile if it doesn't have enzymes?"**

**Bile's crucial roles:**

1. **Emulsification** - breaks fat into tiny droplets (↑ surface area for lipase)
2. **Micelle formation** - transports lipids to brush border
3. **Excretion** - removes bilirubin, cholesterol, drugs
4. **Neutralization** - bile is alkaline, helps neutralize acid

**Without bile:** Massive fat malabsorption (steatorrhea) even with normal pancreatic function

### **5. "Why does the ENS need so many neurons?"**

**Answer:** The gut has complex jobs requiring local control:

- 6-7 meters of small intestine
- Each section needs independent regulation
- Must coordinate:
    - Motility patterns
    - Secretions
    - Blood flow
    - Immune responses
- Can't wait for brain signals (too slow)
- ENS makes local "decisions" then reports to brain

**Analogy:** Like having regional managers who can make day-to-day decisions without calling CEO every time

## EXAM TIPS & KEY CONCEPTS

### **High-Yield Facts:**

1. **Three nervous systems control GIT:**
    
    - PSNS = stimulates ("rest and digest")
    - SNS = inhibits ("fight or flight")
    - ENS = local control (works independently)
2. **Three digestive phases:**
    
    - Cephalic (vagus) → before eating
    - Gastric (distention + gastrin) → in stomach
    - Intestinal (CCK + secretin) → in duodenum
3. **Three stimulants of gastric acid:**
    
    - Acetylcholine (vagus nerve)
    - Gastrin (G cells)
    - Histamine (ECL cells)
    - Work synergistically!
4. **Surface area amplification in small intestine:**
    
    - Circular folds (×3)
    - Villi (×10)
    - Microvilli (×20)
    - Total = ~200 m²
5. **Major absorption sites:**
    
    - **Duodenum:** Iron, calcium
    - **Jejunum:** Most nutrients
    - **Ileum:** B12 (+ intrinsic factor), bile salts
    - **Colon:** Water, electrolytes
6. **What goes to lymph vs blood:**
    
    - **Lymph (lacteals):** Fats (as chylomicrons)
    - **Blood (capillaries):** Everything else (glucose, amino acids, water-soluble vitamins)
7. **Two plexuses of ENS:**
    
    - **Meissner's** (submucosal) → secretion & absorption
    - **Auerbach's** (myenteric) → motility

### **Pattern Recognition:**

**If you see fat malabsorption, think:**

- Pancreatic insufficiency (no lipase)
- Bile duct obstruction (no bile salts)
- Ileal disease (can't reabsorb bile salts)
- Celiac disease (villous atrophy)

**If you see B12 deficiency, think:**

- Pernicious anemia (no intrinsic factor)
- Ileal resection/disease (can't absorb B12-IF complex)
- Chronic PPI use (need acid to release B12 from food)

**If you see diarrhea after antibiotics, think:**

- Killed normal gut flora
- C. difficile overgrowth
- Decreased fermentation → decreased SCFA → colonocytes suffer
