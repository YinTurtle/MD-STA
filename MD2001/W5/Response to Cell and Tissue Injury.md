## Introduction: Why This Matters

Every day, your cells face threats: lack of oxygen, toxins, trauma, inflammation, infection. The body's response to these insults determines whether cells recover, survive in a damaged state, or die. Understanding this is fundamental to understanding disease.

This unit explains what happens when cells are injured, how they die, and what comes next—the crucial processes of healing and repair that keep us functioning.

---

## Part 1: Understanding Cell Injury

### The Big Picture: Three Possible Outcomes

When a cell is injured, one of three things happens:

```
CELL INJURY
    ↓
├─→ ADAPTATION (cell survives but changes)
├─→ REVERSIBLE INJURY (cell survives, returns to normal)
└─→ DEATH (irreversible injury)
    ├─→ APOPTOSIS (programmed, tidy)
    └─→ NECROSIS (pathological, messy)
```

### Factors That Determine the Cell's Fate

**1. The nature of the injury itself**

- **Acute vs. chronic**: A sudden massive burn kills tissue immediately. Chronic low-level toxin exposure may cause gradual changes.
- **Mild vs. severe**: A brief oxygen deprivation might be reversible; prolonged hypoxia causes death.

**2. The cell type affected**

- Different cell types have different resilience
- Neurons are extremely sensitive to hypoxia (death within minutes)
- Fibroblasts can tolerate much longer without oxygen
- Red blood cells can't regenerate at all; skin cells regenerate constantly

**3. Time**

- The longer the injury persists, the more likely it becomes irreversible

### The Critical Role of Membrane Homeostasis

The cell membrane is the boundary that controls everything entering and leaving the cell. **Maintain homeostasis and the cell survives; lose it and the cell dies.**

Key ions controlled across the membrane:

- **Sodium (Na+)** — mostly outside the cell
- **Potassium (K+)** — mostly inside the cell
- **Calcium (Ca2+)** — tightly controlled, mostly outside (critical for this unit)

These gradients are maintained by **ATP-dependent pumps** (primarily the Na+/K+-ATPase pump).

**When injury occurs and ATP depletes:**

- Pumps fail
- Sodium floods in, water follows (cells swell)
- Potassium leaks out
- Calcium enters (catastrophic for cell function)
- Organelles swell and rupture
- Cell dies

---

## Part 2: Types of Sublethal (Reversible) Injury

These are situations where the cell is damaged but can recover if the injury is removed.

### Hydropic Change (Cellular Edema)

**What it is:** Swelling of the cell due to water accumulation inside

**Why it happens:**

- Injury impairs the Na+/K+-ATPase pump
- Sodium accumulates inside the cell
- Water follows osmotically (to dilute the sodium)
- The cell swells like a water balloon

**Mechanism:**

```
Injury (hypoxia, toxin, etc.)
    ↓
ATP depletion
    ↓
Na+/K+-ATPase pump fails
    ↓
Na+ accumulates inside
    ↓
Water follows osmotically
    ↓
CELL SWELLS (hydropic change)
```

**Microscopic appearance:**

- Cell becomes pale and swollen
- Nucleus remains intact but may be pushed to the periphery
- Organelles become diluted and harder to see

**Clinical example:** Liver cells in cholestasis (bile backup)

- The liver is congested with bile
- Bilirubin accumulates (giving the yellow color)
- Liver cells develop hydropic change as they struggle with the metabolic burden
- You'll see this clinically as jaundice

**Important:** Hydropic change is **reversible** if the injury is removed. Remove the obstruction, drain the bile, restore oxygen, and the cell can recover.

### Fatty Change (Steatosis)

**What it is:** Abnormal accumulation of fat (lipid) droplets inside cells, particularly liver and heart cells

**Why it happens:**

- Cells use fat as an energy source
- If fat uptake exceeds fat oxidation (or export), fat accumulates
- Can occur with inadequate nutrition, obesity, diabetes, alcohol, toxins

**Mechanism:**

```
Excess lipid uptake OR impaired oxidation OR impaired export
    ↓
Fat accumulates in cytoplasm as lipid droplets
    ↓
Cell swells, nucleus pushed aside
    ↓
FATTY CHANGE (steatosis)
```

**Clinical examples:**

|Cause|Tissue Affected|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|**Alcohol**|Liver|Alcoholic fatty liver disease; can progress to cirrhosis|
|**Obesity**|Liver|Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD); extremely common now|
|**Malnutrition**|Liver, Heart|Cells can't generate energy efficiently; fat accumulates|
|**Diabetes**|Heart|High lipid levels + insulin resistance → lipid overload|
|**Hepatitis**|Liver|Viral or autoimmune injury impairs fat metabolism|

**Important distinction:** Fatty change itself is usually reversible. Lose weight, stop drinking alcohol, control diabetes—the fat can mobilize and be used or cleared. However, if fatty change is severe and chronic, it can progress to inflammation (steatohepatitis), fibrosis, and cirrhosis.

**Microscopic appearance:**

- Large, clear lipid droplets fill the cytoplasm
- Nucleus pushed to the periphery (looks like a signet ring)
- Oil Red O stain (special stain) highlights the fat bright red

### Autophagy (and Atrophy)

**Autophagy** is the cell's own recycling system. When injured but not dying, cells activate autophagy to break down damaged organelles and recycle their components.

**What it means:** "Auto" = self, "phagy" = eating. The cell eats itself.

**Why it's important:**

- Removes damaged mitochondria and proteins
- Generates energy from recycled components
- Actually protective in some contexts
- Can fail, leading to accumulation of toxic proteins (seen in neurodegeneration)

**Process:**

1. Damaged organelle is enclosed in a membrane (autophagosome)
2. This fuses with a lysosome (the cell's garbage disposal)
3. Contents are digested and recycled
4. Useful building blocks are recovered

**Clinical relevance:** Impaired autophagy is implicated in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease—toxic proteins accumulate because the cell can't clear them efficiently.

**Atrophy** is a reduction in cell size due to loss of cell components. It's often a response to chronic injury or disuse.

**Example:** A patient's arm is immobilized in a cast for 6 weeks. The muscles atrophy (shrink) because:

- They're not being used
- Protein synthesis decreases
- Autophagy removes unneeded components
- The muscles shrink but can regain size with physiotherapy

## Part 3: Understanding Cell Death

Cell death is the most critical outcome of severe injury. Understanding the different types of cell death is essential.

### The Fundamental Distinction: Apoptosis vs. Necrosis

This is one of the most important concepts in pathology. These are two fundamentally different ways cells die.

```
                    APOPTOSIS                    vs                    NECROSIS
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TIMING              Slow (hours)                                      Fast (minutes)
CAUSE               Programmed/intentional                            Pathological/accidental
CELL MEMBRANE       Intact (initially)                                Ruptures early
CONTENTS LEAK       No (contained)                                    Yes (released into tissue)
INFLAMMATION        Minimal                                           Severe
ENERGY (ATP)        Required (active process)                         Not required
APPEARANCE          Apoptotic bodies (neat fragments)                 Cell ruptures, contents spilled

```

### Apoptosis: Programmed Cell Death (PCD)

**What it is:** A genetically encoded, controlled process where the cell deliberately kills itself

**The key insight:** Apoptosis is a _feature_, not a bug. It's necessary for:

- Normal development (sculpting fingers in the embryo)
- Maintaining tissue homeostasis (controlling cell numbers)
- Removing damaged or dangerous cells
- Protecting against cancer

**Where apoptosis occurs naturally:**

**1. Embryology**

- A human embryo starts with webbed digits (connected fingers)
- Apoptosis removes the cells between fingers to create separate digits
- Without apoptosis, you'd have flippers instead of hands

**2. Menstrual Cycle**

- Endometrial tissue builds up during the proliferative phase
- If pregnancy doesn't occur, the endometrium undergoes apoptosis
- The tissue dies and is shed as menstruation

**3. Immune Defense**

- Neutrophils are short-lived cells (1-2 days in circulation)
- They undergo apoptosis naturally
- Dead neutrophils are removed by macrophages
- This is the normal resolution of inflammation (why pus gradually disappears)

**4. T Cell and Killer Cell Responses**

- After fighting infection, activated T cells undergo apoptosis
- This prevents the immune response from causing collateral damage
- Autoimmune diseases occur when this regulation fails

**5. Tumor Prevention**

- Cells with serious DNA damage can detect this
- They undergo apoptosis rather than risk becoming cancer
- This is a crucial defense against cancer

**6. Other Processes**

- **Red blood cell formation:** As the nucleus is extruded from a developing RBC, apoptosis-like mechanisms are involved
- **Platelet formation:** Megakaryocytes undergo fragmentation that resembles apoptosis
- **Keratinocyte maturation:** Skin cells undergo controlled apoptosis as they reach the surface and are shed
![[Pasted image 20251014141931.png]]

**Mechanism of apoptosis (the pathway):**

**Extrinsic pathway (death receptor pathway):**

```
External signal (e.g., TNF-α, Fas ligand) → Death receptor on cell surface
    ↓
Death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) forms
    ↓
Caspase-8 activation
    ↓
Caspase-3 activation
    ↓
APOPTOSIS
```

**Intrinsic pathway (mitochondrial pathway):**

```
Internal stress (DNA damage, hypoxia, growth factor withdrawal)
    ↓
p53 protein activated (the "guardian of the genome")
    ↓
Mitochondrial membrane permeabilized
    ↓
Cytochrome c released from mitochondria
    ↓
Apoptosome formation
    ↓
Caspase-9 activation
    ↓
Caspase-3 activation
    ↓
APOPTOSIS
```

**The executioner:** Caspase-3 is the central executioner. Once activated, it:

- Cuts DNA into neat fragments
- Dismantles the cytoskeleton
- Condenses the nucleus
- Fragments the cell into apoptotic bodies
- Each piece is wrapped in membrane, keeping contents contained

**Morphological features (how it looks under the microscope):**

- Cell shrinks
- Nucleus becomes dense and fragmented (pyknosis)
- DNA breaks into neat ladder-like fragments
- Cell breaks into membrane-bound apoptotic bodies
- Macrophages clean up the pieces without inflammation

**Why this matters clinically:** If apoptosis regulation goes wrong, two problems develop:

- **Too little apoptosis:** Cells that should die don't. Risk of cancer, autoimmune disease
- **Too much apoptosis:** Excessive cell death. Seen in AIDS (HIV kills CD4+ T cells), neurodegenerative diseases

---

### Variations on the Theme: Other Forms of Cell Death

Beyond apoptosis and necrosis, there are several other forms of regulated cell death that are important to know:

**1. Necroptosis**

- A form of cell death that has **features of both apoptosis and necrosis**
- Like necrosis: causes cell swelling and rupture (messy)
- Like apoptosis: it's regulated and controlled
- **Where it occurs:** Implicated in viral infections and neurodegeneration (e.g., Alzheimer's disease)
- **Why it matters:** Opens the door to therapeutic intervention—if you can block necroptosis, you might slow neurodegeneration
- **Mechanism:** Receptor-interacting serine/threonine kinases (RIPK) orchestrate the process

**2. Ferroptosis**

- Iron-dependent cell death
- Triggered by iron accumulation and lipid peroxidation
- **Where it occurs:** Hemochromatosis (iron overload), some neurodegenerative diseases
- **Why it matters:** Iron-chelating drugs might prevent cell death in these conditions
- **Mechanism:** Glutathione depletion leads to accumulation of lipid peroxides, causing membrane rupture

**3. Pyroptosis**

- "Fiery death" — a highly inflammatory form of cell death
- Occurs during severe infection (bacteria like Salmonella, Shigella)
- Involves inflammatory caspases (caspase-1, caspase-11) rather than apoptotic caspases
- **Result:** Massive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-18)
- **Why it matters:** Excessive pyroptosis drives severe inflammation and sepsis
- **Clinical example:** Severe bacterial infection → pyroptosis of infected cells → overwhelming inflammation

**4. Macroautophagy (in context of cell death)**

- Excessive autophagy can lead to cell death
- Also called "autophagic cell death"
- The cell eats itself to death
- **Where it occurs:** Some cancer cells treated with certain drugs; starvation conditions
- **Why it matters:** Understanding this helps explain why some therapies work

**5. Anoikis**

- "Without home" cell death
- Occurs when epithelial cells lose contact with the extracellular matrix
- **Why it matters:** Cancer cells must escape anoikis to metastasize. Understanding anoikis is crucial for cancer biology

---

### Necrosis: Pathological Cell Death

**What it is:** Uncontrolled, catastrophic cell death resulting from severe, acute injury

**Why it happens:**

- Severe injury overwhelms the cell's defenses
- ATP is depleted
- Cell can't control its own death
- Membrane ruptures
- Contents spill into surrounding tissue

**The cascade:**

```
SEVERE INJURY (hypoxia, severe trauma, toxin, etc.)
    ↓
ATP severely depleted → pumps fail
    ↓
Na+ floods in → cell swells
    ↓
K+ leaks out
    ↓
Ca2+ enters → activates destructive enzymes
    ↓
Organelles swell and rupture
    ↓
Cell membrane ruptures
    ↓
CELL CONTENTS SPILLED INTO TISSUE
    ↓
Inflammatory response → damage to surrounding tissue
```

**Why calcium is the villain:** When calcium enters the cell in excessive amounts, it activates:

- **Proteases** (cut up proteins)
- **Phospholipases** (destroy membranes)
- **Endonucleases** (chop up DNA)
- **ATPases** (drain remaining ATP)

It's like opening Pandora's box of destructive enzymes.

**Morphological features (necrosis looks different from apoptosis):**

- Cell swells (hydropic change)
- Nucleus becomes ill-defined
- DNA degrades randomly (not neatly), creating a "smudged" appearance
- Mitochondria swell and rupture
- **No membrane-bound apoptotic bodies** — contents are released

**Types of necrosis (classified by appearance and location):**

#### 1. **Coagulative Necrosis**

**Appearance:** The tissue structure is preserved but cells are dead (looks like a ghost outline of the original tissue)

**Cause:** Most commonly **ischemia** (lack of blood supply, especially in the heart after MI)

**Mechanism:**

- Ischemia causes protein denaturation
- Proteins coagulate (like egg white cooking)
- The tissue outline remains but cells are dead
- Enzymes are inactive without blood supply, so tissue doesn't dissolve immediately

**Clinical example:** **Myocardial infarction (heart attack)**

- Coronary artery occlusion → no blood flow to heart muscle
- Muscle cells die
- The dead muscle (infarct) is coagulative necrosis
- Over days, the body removes the dead tissue and replaces it with scar
- This is why we see "old MI with scarring" on EKG

**Microscopic appearance:** Dead tissue with preserved outlines but no nuclei; looks "ghost-like"

#### 2. **Colliquative Necrosis**

**Appearance:** Complete liquefaction of tissue (turns into liquid/pus)

**Cause:** **Bacterial infection** (bacteria and white blood cells release enzymes that liquefy tissue)

**Mechanism:**

- Bacteria invade tissue
- Neutrophils and macrophages swarm in to fight infection
- These immune cells release powerful digestive enzymes
- Tissue is literally digested by these enzymes
- Result: liquefied, purulent (pus-filled) tissue

**Clinical example:** **Brain abscess**

- Bacteria reach the brain (through septicemia, direct trauma, or hematogenous spread)
- Immune response creates a pocket of pus
- The brain tissue in the center of the abscess becomes completely liquefied
- You see a "ring-enhancing lesion" on MRI (ring of inflammation around liquid center)

**Other examples:** Lung abscess, liver abscess, any infected tissue that liquefies

**Microscopic appearance:** Absence of normal tissue structure; liquid debris and inflammatory cells

#### 3. **Caseous Necrosis**

**Appearance:** "Cheese-like" material (between coagulation and liquefaction)

**Cause:** **Mycobacterium tuberculosis** and some fungi

**Mechanism:**

- TB bacteria trigger a unique immune response (granuloma formation)
- Epithelioid macrophages surround the bacteria
- The center of the granuloma dies
- The dead tissue has a crumbly, cheese-like consistency
- Enzymes from granuloma cells partially liquefy it, but fibrin (from coagulation) stabilizes it

**Why it's important:** This is the hallmark of TB pathology

**Clinical example:** **Pulmonary tuberculosis**

- TB bacilli reach lungs
- Granulomas form
- Caseous necrosis in the center of granulomas
- The necrotic material can be coughed up (hemoptysis—coughing blood)
- Cavitary TB occurs when caseous material is liquefied and expelled

**Microscopic appearance:** Acellular, amorphous debris with a distinctive appearance between coagulation and liquefaction

#### 4. **Gangrenous Necrosis**

**Appearance:** Large area of coagulative necrosis + superimposed colliquative necrosis (tissue is black, dry, then wet)

**Cause:** **Ischemia + secondary bacterial infection**

**Mechanism:**

```
Ischemia (loss of blood supply)
    ↓
Coagulative necrosis of large tissue area (foot, limb)
    ↓
Bacteria invade the dead tissue
    ↓
Colliquative necrosis occurs (bacteria digest tissue)
    ↓
GANGRENE (black, infected, necrotic tissue)
```

**Clinical example:** **Diabetic gangrene of the foot**

- Diabetes → peripheral vascular disease → poor circulation to foot
- Minor injury → ulcer forms
- No blood flow → can't heal, becomes infected
- Bacteria thrive in dead tissue
- Tissue becomes black and putrid
- May require amputation

**Types of gangrene:**

- **Dry gangrene:** Ischemic tissue without bacterial superinfection (appears brown/black, dry, well-demarcated border)
- **Wet gangrene:** Ischemic tissue + bacterial infection (appears black/wet, poorly demarcated, offensive odor, spreads rapidly)

**Why it matters:** Wet gangrene is a surgical emergency—antibiotics and often amputation are needed to save the patient's life

#### 5. **Fat Necrosis**

**Appearance:** Areas of discoloration where fat has been digested; chalky, saponified fat remains

**Cause:** **Enzymatic digestion by pancreatic lipase** (especially in acute pancreatitis)

**Mechanism:**

```
Acute pancreatitis → pancreatic cells rupture
    ↓
Pancreatic lipase released into surrounding tissue
    ↓
Lipase digests fat in surrounding tissues
    ↓
Free fatty acids form
    ↓
Fatty acids bind calcium → chalky deposits
    ↓
FAT NECROSIS (areas of discoloration, saponification)
```

**Why it's important:**

- Seen in acute pancreatitis
- Can cause life-threatening hypocalcemia if extensive (lipase binds calcium)
- Visual marker of pancreatic injury

**Microscopic appearance:** Areas of necrotic fat surrounded by inflammatory cells; saponified fat (chalky deposits) visible

**Clinical note:** In severe pancreatitis, fat necrosis can occur not just in the pancreas but also in surrounding tissues (omentum, peritoneal fat). You might see "fat necrosis" in various locations in a pancreatitis patient.

#### 6. **Fibrinoid Necrosis**

**Appearance:** Fibrin deposition in vessel walls; vessel wall appears bright pink and homogeneous

**Cause:** **Severe, accelerated hypertension** or immune complex deposition (vasculitis)

**Mechanism:**

```
Severe hypertension
    ↓
Endothelial injury
    ↓
Vessel wall damage
    ↓
Plasma proteins (including fibrin) insude (seep) into vessel wall
    ↓
Fibrin-coagulation cascade activates
    ↓
FIBRINOID NECROSIS (fibrin in vessel wall)
```

**Why it matters:** Sign of malignant hypertension (medical emergency)

**Clinical example:** **Malignant hypertension**

- BP > 180/120 mm Hg with end-organ damage
- Retinal hemorrhages (fibrinoid necrosis of retinal vessels)
- Acute kidney injury (fibrinoid necrosis of glomeruli)
- Hypertensive encephalopathy (fibrinoid necrosis of cerebral vessels)

**Microscopic appearance:** Homogeneous, bright pink vessel wall with fibrin deposition; vessels appear necrotic

**Apoptosis verses Necrosis**

### Abnormal Apoptosis Regulation: The Bridge to Disease

Both too much and too little apoptosis cause disease:

**Too little apoptosis:**

- Cells that should die don't
- **Cancer:** Tumor cells escape apoptosis through mutations (e.g., BCL-2 overexpression, p53 mutations)
- **Autoimmune disease:** Autoreactive lymphocytes should be eliminated but aren't
- **Viral infection (chronic):** HIV-infected cells that should die don't

**Too much apoptosis:**

- **AIDS:** HIV kills CD4+ T cells, leading to immunosuppression
- **Neurodegenerative diseases:** Excessive neuronal apoptosis (Alzheimer's, Parkinson's)
- **Acute ischemic stroke:** Brain cells undergo apoptosis when oxygen is cut off
- **Sepsis:** Immune cells undergo apoptosis, worsening immunosuppression

**Therapeutic implications:** If we can shift the balance—promoting apoptosis of cancer cells or preventing apoptosis of immune cells—we can treat disease. This is the basis for many cancer drugs and immunotherapies.

## Part 4: Outcomes of Cell Injury

After injury, the tissue faces three possible outcomes:

```
INJURY
  ↓
├─→ COMPLETE HEALING (back to normal) ✓
├─→ REPAIR (restored function but with scarring) ≈
└─→ CHRONIC DISEASE (ongoing damage, progressive dysfunction) ✗
```

### Healing vs. Repair: The Critical Distinction

**Healing** = **Complete restoration** to normal

- Original cell type regenerates
- Original architecture restored
- Full function returns
- No scar

**Repair** = **Restoration of function but with compromise**

- Original cell type may not regenerate
- Function restored but with fibrous scar
- Not truly "healed"—patched with scar tissue

**Key concept:** "Healing is complete resolution; repair is second best option."

**Which tissues can do which?**

The capacity for regeneration depends on the cell type. Tissues are classified by their regenerative potential:

---

## Part 5: Cell Types and Regenerative Capacity

Understanding which cells can regenerate is essential for predicting outcomes after injury.

### Three Categories of Cells

#### **1. LABILE CELLS** (Continuously dividing)

These cells divide rapidly throughout life to replace lost cells.

**Characteristics:**

- Stem cells actively dividing
- Short lifespan of mature cells
- Constant turnover

**Examples:**

- **Blood cells** (RBCs, WBCs, platelets) — replaced every 100-120 days (RBC), hours to days (WBCs)
- **Skin cells** — epidermis completely replaced every 2-4 weeks
- **Intestinal epithelial cells** — completely replaced every 3-5 days

**Regenerative capacity:** **EXCELLENT**

**Clinical implication:** These tissues heal quickly. A small wound to skin heals by healing (complete regeneration). Losing blood cells triggers increased production from bone marrow.

**What happens with injury:**

- Surface burn of skin → epidermis regenerates completely
- Small GI ulcer → epithelium regenerates quickly
- Blood loss → bone marrow increases production

---

#### **2. STABLE CELLS** (Rarely dividing, but can divide when needed)

These cells normally don't divide, but retain the ability to divide in response to injury or growth stimuli.

**Characteristics:**

- G0 phase (resting state) under normal conditions
- Can re-enter cell cycle in response to growth factors or injury
- Can regenerate if most (but not all) tissue is lost

**Examples:**

- **Liver** — can regenerate even if 70% is removed; remaining hepatocytes proliferate
- **Kidney** — can compensate for nephron loss; remaining nephrons enlarge
- **Bone** — can regenerate after fracture
- **Muscle** (smooth and cardiac) — limited regeneration in healthy muscle, but satellite cells can contribute

**Regenerative capacity:** **MODERATE**

**Clinical implication:** These tissues can recover from substantial injury, but if injury is severe or chronic, they scar.

**What happens with injury:**

- **Liver:** Partial hepatectomy (surgical removal) → remaining hepatocytes proliferate to restore liver mass (can take weeks to months)
- **Kidney:** Chronic glomerulonephritis destroys some nephrons → remaining nephrons hypertrophy and filter more, maintaining function (for a time)
- **Bone:** Fracture → bone cells proliferate and new bone forms to bridge the gap

**Important caveat:** If damage is extensive or chronic, stable cells can't keep up. Result: fibrosis (scarring) instead of regeneration.

---

#### **3. PERMANENT CELLS** (Never divide after maturity)

These cells lose the ability to divide after maturation. Once lost, they cannot be replaced.

**Characteristics:**

- Lost ability to divide early in life
- Cannot be regenerated if damaged
- Only injury repair option: replacement with scar tissue
- Loss of these cells leads to permanent dysfunction

**Examples:**

- **Neurons** — fully differentiated by infancy; cannot divide; if destroyed, lost forever
- **Skeletal muscle** — mature fibers cannot divide; satellite cells provide limited regeneration
- **Cardiac muscle** — cardiomyocytes cannot divide; scar tissue replaces dead muscle

**Regenerative capacity:** **NONE (or minimal)**

**Clinical implications:** These are the most serious injuries.

**What happens with injury:**

- **Stroke (brain):** Dead neurons cannot be replaced → permanent neurological deficit
- **Myocardial infarction (heart):** Dead cardiomyocytes cannot be replaced → scar tissue; reduced cardiac output
- **Spinal cord injury:** Damaged neurons cannot regenerate → permanent paralysis (though there's ongoing research into regeneration strategies)

**Key difference from skeletal muscle:** Skeletal muscle has satellite cells (muscle stem cells) that can provide limited regeneration. Cardiac muscle does not; it's truly permanent.

---

### Visual Summary: Regenerative Capacity

```
LABILE CELLS                    STABLE CELLS                    PERMANENT CELLS
(Blood, Skin, GI)              (Liver, Kidney, Bone)           (Neuron, Cardiac Muscle)

ALWAYS DIVIDING                 RARELY DIVIDE                   NEVER DIVIDE

Fast turnover                   Can proliferate if injured       Cannot regenerate
Complete regeneration           Moderate regeneration possible   Permanent loss → scarring
Best prognosis after injury     Medium prognosis                Worst prognosis
```

## Part 6: The Process of Healing and Repair

Let's now look at what happens after injury—how tissues heal or scar.

### Skin Healing: The Classic Model

Skin is the ideal model for understanding wound healing because:

- Easy to observe
- Occurs frequently
- Demonstrates both healing and repair

**Question from the handout:** "Are these really so different? How do they differ?"

**Answer:** Yes, healing by primary and secondary intention are fundamentally different processes with different timelines and outcomes.

### Healing by Primary Intention (Primary Union)

**When it occurs:** Clean, small wounds brought together with minimal tissue loss (e.g., surgical incisions, clean lacerations)

**Requirements:**

- Minimal tissue loss
- Clean edges that can be approximated
- Edges held together (sutures, staples)
- Low contamination risk

**Timeline:**

```
DAY 0-3: INFLAMMATORY PHASE
├─ Immediate: Hemostasis (bleeding stops via clotting)
├─ Hours: Neutrophils infiltrate (fight infection, clean debris)
├─ Days 1-3: Fibrin clot forms the scaffold
└─ Minimal necrosis; clean edges

DAY 3-7: PROLIFERATIVE PHASE
├─ Macrophages arrive (remove debris, secrete growth factors)
├─ Fibroblasts arrive and proliferate
├─ New blood vessels form (angiogenesis)
├─ Collagen deposition begins
└─ Epithelial cells proliferate to cover wound

DAY 7-14: REMODELING/MATURATION PHASE
├─ Collagen is reorganized and cross-linked
├─ Tensile strength increases
├─ Inflammation resolves
├─ Blood vessels normalize
└─ By day 14: wound has 70% of original strength

LATER (Weeks to Months): CONTINUED REMODELING
└─ Collagen continues to remodel
└─ By 1 year: wound has 80-90% of original tensile strength
```

**Outcome:** Thin, neat scar with minimal tissue loss and good cosmetic result

**Key point:** Because edges are approximated and there's minimal gap to fill, healing is relatively quick and the scar is minimal.

---

### Healing by Secondary Intention (Secondary Union)

**When it occurs:** Large wounds with significant tissue loss; edges cannot be brought together; wound is left open to heal (e.g., diabetic ulcers, extensive burns, large traumatic wounds)

**Process:** Much more complex than primary intention because the body must fill the gap with new tissue.

**Timeline:**

```
DAY 0-3: INFLAMMATORY PHASE
├─ Hemostasis (clotting)
├─ Intense neutrophil infiltration (clean debris from large wound)
├─ Fibrin clot forms
└─ Significant necrosis may occur

DAY 3-7: PROLIFERATIVE PHASE
├─ GRANULATION TISSUE forms (NEW)
│  └─ This is the hallmark of secondary intention
│  └─ Mix of: new blood vessels, fibroblasts, and inflammatory cells
│  └─ Appears red/granular (hence "granulation")
│
├─ Epithelial cells proliferate from edges, inward
├─ Fibroblasts proliferate and lay down collagen
└─ Angiogenesis is robust (new blood vessels needed to fill large gap)

DAY 7-21: ORGANIZATION PHASE
├─ Granulation tissue is gradually replaced by fibrous tissue (scar)
├─ Collagen is reorganized
├─ Inflammatory cells decrease
└─ Epithelialization
```

### Wound strength

- Sutures removed at end of week 1
- Strength 10% of the strength of unwounded skin
- Strength increases rapidly over the following 4 weeks
- Rate of increase wlos
- By third month strength at 70-80%
- Full strength may not be recovered

### Factors that influence wound healing

**Systemic**
- Age - delayed healing in old and very young
- Nutrition - affects protein and collagen synthesis
- Metabolic status - healing delayed in diabetics
- Circulatory status - adequate blood supply essential
- Hormones - glucocorticoids anti-inflammatory but impair collagen synthesis

**Local**
- Infection - most important cause of healing delay
- Mechanical factors - early movement of wounds delays healing
- Foreign bodies - e.g. sutures or glass
- Size, location and type of wound - wounds heal better in richly vascularised areas


### Abnormal wound

- *Deficient scar formation*
	- Dehiscence
	- Ulceration
- *Excessive formation of repair components*
	- Keloid scar
		- Due to overproduction of collagen
- *Formation of contractures*
	- Exaggerated contraction
	- Deformity of the wound and surrounding tissues

### Effects of scars

- Functionally imperfect but
	- provides permanent patch
	- allows surrounding tissue to continue function
- May cause problems
	- cosmetic
	- functional
		- site e.g. stricture
		- size e.g. healed myocardial infarct

Summary:

- Lethal injury of the cell = irreversible
	- necrosis - 60% of death of tissues
		- coagulative necrosis
		- The fat liquified - called colliquative necrosis
		- Caseous necrosis is seen in tuberculosis
- During pregnancy, the foetus's hand's "web" cell needs to be removed, but it cant just die to become necrosis which is pro-inflammatory
	- So apoptosis occurs
- When bone is first broken (look over)
	- bleeding, hematoma formation (clot formation)
		- stops bleeding
	- inflammatory phase
		- neutrophils arrive to clear dead tissue and prevent infection
		- followed by macrophages that continue cleaning and release cytokines and growth factors
		- mesenchymal stem cells will differentiate into bone and cartilage cells
	- granulation tissue and cartilage development
		- hematoma is replaced by granulation tissue, which is a soft fibrous tissue
		- MSCs (mesenchymal stem cells) differentiate into chondroblasts (cartilage cells) and fibroblasts, which produce a soft callus made of fibrocartilage
			- not strong enough for weight-bearing
	- Hard callus formation
		- osteoblasts, bone forming cells derived from MSCs, deposit woven bone, replacing soft callus
			- this process is known as endochondral ossification
			- hard bony callus forms

|Stage|Key Tissue/Cell Types|Role|
|---|---|---|
|Hematoma Formation|Blood clot, platelets|Stop bleeding, stabilize fracture|
|Inflammatory Phase|Neutrophils, macrophages|Clean debris, secrete healing signals|
|Soft Callus Formation|Granulation tissue, chondroblasts, fibroblasts|Form soft bridge (fibrocartilage)|
|Hard Callus Formation|Osteoblasts|Deposit new bone, mineralize callus|
|Remodeling|Osteoclasts, osteoblasts|Reshape bone to normal anatomy|
