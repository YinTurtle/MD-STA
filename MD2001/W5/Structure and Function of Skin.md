## OVERVIEW: Three Main Layers

**EPIDERMIS** → Avascular (no blood vessels), stratified squamous keratinized epithelium

- Undergoes proliferation and synthesizes keratin
- Think of it as a brick wall being constantly rebuilt from the bottom up

**DERMIS** → Vascular, tough connective tissue ("leather layer")

- Contains blood vessels, lymphatics, nerves
- Collagen and elastic fibers (don't replace with age - this is why elderly skin becomes fragile)

**HYPODERMIS** → Superficial fascia, variable thickness

- Fatty tissue (adipose)
- Blood vessels, nerves, lymphatics
- Contains skin ligaments (determines if skin is loose or taut - important for surgical incisions and scarring)

## EPIDERMIS: The Five Layers (Deep to Superficial)

### 1. **STRATUM BASALE** (Basal Layer)

**Key Function:** Proliferation - where stem cells divide (mitosis occurs here)

**Structure:**

- Single layer of cells at the basement membrane
- **Hemidesmosomes** anchor cells to basal lamina
- **Collagen VII** anchors dermis to basal lamina

**Clinical Correlation:**

- **Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa** = mutation in Collagen VII
- Results in severe blistering because epidermis can't properly anchor to dermis
- Think of it like wallpaper peeling off because the glue is defective

### 2. **STRATUM SPINOSUM** (Prickle Cell Layer)

**Key Function:** Differentiation begins

**Structure:**

- Multiple layers of cells
- Express **keratin K1/K10** (intermediate filaments)
- Cells linked by **desmosomes** (cell-to-cell connections)
- Called "spinosum" because cells look spiky under microscope due to desmosomes

**Analogy:** Think of desmosomes as rivets holding metal plates together - they provide strength and prevent the layers from separating

### 3. **STRATUM GRANULOSUM** (Granular Layer)

**Key Function:** Start of waterproofing

**Structure:**

- Contains **keratohyalin granules**
- These granules contain **pro-filaggrin** → breaks down into **filaggrin**

**FILAGGRIN - CRITICAL PROTEIN:**

- Aggregates keratin filaments together
- Cleaved into amino acids that help maintain moisture
- Creates optimal skin barrier

**Clinical Correlations:**

- Mutations in filaggrin gene = **MOST COMMON cause of keratinization disorders**
- **Ichthyosis vulgaris** = dry, scaly skin (filaggrin mutation)
- Found in **50% of severe eczema cases**
- Associated with **asthma** (null mutations)
- If you see severe eczema + asthma, think filaggrin mutation
- Higher treatment costs correlate with presence of mutations

### 4. **STRATUM LUCIDUM** (Clear Layer)

- Only in **thick skin** (palms, soles)
- Not present in thin skin
- Not emphasized in these notes

### 5. **STRATUM CORNEUM** (Horny Layer)

**Key Function:** Protection and waterproofing

**Structure:**

- Dead cells ("cell ghosts") filled with keratin
- Waterproof layer
- Undergoes **desquamation** (shedding)

**Timeframe:** Takes **20-30 days** from cell division in stratum basale to shedding from stratum corneum

**Analogy:** Like shingles on a roof - dead, overlapping, and waterproof

---

## KERATIN EXPRESSION PATTERNS

**Stratum Basale:** Expresses **K5** keratin **Stratum Spinosum & above:** Expresses **K1/K10** keratin

**Why this matters:** Tightly regulated by differentiation program - tells you what stage of maturation the cell is in

---

## OTHER IMPORTANT CELL TYPES IN EPIDERMIS

### **MELANOCYTES** (in Stratum Basale)

**Origin:** Neural crest cells

**Function:** Synthesize and release **melanin** (brown pigment)

**Two Types of Melanin:**

- **Eumelanin** (brown-black)
- **Pheomelanin** (red-yellow)

**Key Process - Melanogenesis:**

1. Melanocytes produce melanin in specialized lysosomes called **melanosomes**
2. Melanosomes transferred to keratinocytes via endocytosis
3. Melanin sits like an umbrella over the nucleus protecting DNA

**Functions:**

- Absorbs UV-B radiation
- Prevents DNA damage to underlying cells
- Lower skin cancer incidence in individuals with more melanin

**Clinical:**

- **Melanoma** = tumor of melanocytes, caused by UV radiation exposure

### **LANGERHANS CELLS** (mostly in Stratum Spinosum)

**Origin:** Derived from monocytes (bone marrow)

**Characteristics:**

- Macrophage-like
- Dendritic (branching) appearance
- Most abundant in stratum spinosum

**Function:** **Immune surveillance**

- Capture antigens in skin
- Process antigens
- Present antigens to T-cells
- Activated in skin but **migrate to lymph nodes** to activate immune response

**Special Feature:**

- Express **Langerin** protein
- Helps bind and degrade viruses (including HIV) in specialized endosomes called **Birbeck granules**

**Analogy:** Think of Langerhans cells as border patrol agents - they sample what's coming through the skin barrier and report threats to headquarters (lymph nodes)

## DERMIS: The Support Layer

### **Structure:**

**Two sublayers:**

1. **Papillary Dermis** (superficial)
    
    - Fine collagen and elastic fibers
    - Small blood vessels and nerves
    - Forms **rete ridges** (finger-like projections into epidermis)
2. **Reticular Dermis** (deep)
    
    - Dense irregular connective tissue
    - Coarse collagen and elastic fibers
    - Large blood vessels and nerves
    - This is what becomes "leather" when processed

### **Dermo-epidermal Junction:**

- Complex interdigitating structure
- Prevents shearing forces from separating layers
- **Papillae flatten with age** → elderly skin more vulnerable to trauma

**Clinical:** Burns are dangerous because:

- Loss of skin barrier function
- Fluid loss (dehydration)
- Infection risk

---

## HYPODERMIS (Superficial Fascia)

### **Composition:**

- Loose connective tissue
- Adipose tissue (variable thickness in different body areas)

### **Contains:**

- Deep portions of hair follicles
- Eccrine and apocrine glands
- Superficial blood vessels and lymphatics
- Cutaneous nerves
- **Skin ligaments** (determine skin mobility - important for surgical planning)

### **Note on Vitamin D:**

- Some older textbooks say hypodermis produces vitamin D
- **This is INCORRECT** - vitamin D synthesis occurs in **keratinocytes** (epidermis)

---

## SKIN APPENDAGES

### **1. SWEAT GLANDS**

#### **ECCRINE SWEAT GLANDS**

**Structure:**

- Simple coiled tubular glands
- Lie in dermis and hypodermis
- Duct opens directly onto skin surface

**Function:**

- Secrete **watery fluid** (mostly water and salt)
- Controlled by **sympathetic nervous system**
- **Thermoregulation** (cooling)
- Also activated by fear (fight-or-flight response)

**Distribution:** All over body, especially palms, soles, forehead

#### **APOCRINE SWEAT GLANDS**

**Structure:**

- Open into **hair follicles** (not directly onto skin)
- Larger than eccrine glands

**Function:**

- Secrete **milky secretion** containing pheromones
- Become active at puberty

**Distribution:** Axillae (armpits), genital region, areolae

**Clinical:** Body odor from bacterial breakdown of apocrine secretions

---

### **2. PILOSEBACEOUS UNIT** (Hair Complex)

**Components:**

1. **Hair follicle** - cylindrical epithelial structure
2. **Hair shaft** - composed of keratin, grows from bulb
3. **Sebaceous glands** - open into follicle
4. **Arrector pili muscle** - smooth muscle

**Hair Follicle:**

- Derived from epidermis
- Anchored in hypodermis
- Hair bulb at base contains stem cells

**Sebaceous Glands:**

- Secrete **sebum** (oily substance)
- Lubricates hair and adjacent skin
- Prevents water loss
- Contains antimicrobial lipids

**Arrector Pili:**

- Smooth muscle attached to:
    - Papillary dermis (superficial)
    - Hair follicle sheath (deep)
- Controlled by sympathetic nervous system
- Contraction pulls hair upright = **"goosebumps"**

**Evolutionary note:** In animals with fur, this traps insulating air; in humans, mostly vestigial

---

### **3. OTHER APPENDAGES**

**NAILS:**

- Nail plate = keratin
- Rests on nail bed
- Grows from nail root (extends deep into dermis)

**MAMMARY GLANDS:**

- Modified apocrine sweat glands
- Lactation under hormonal control

**TEETH:**

- Enamel from epithelium
- Dentine, pulp, periodontal membrane from mesoderm/neural crest
- Periodontal membrane = fibrous joint between teeth and skull

## MAJOR FUNCTIONS OF SKIN

### **1. PROTECTION**

- **Barrier function:** Prevents fluid loss
- **Physical barrier:** Against mechanical trauma
- **Waterproofing:** Prevents water entry
- **Antimicrobial:** Against microorganisms
- **UV protection:** Via melanin

### **2. SENSATION**

Multiple receptor types with different sized receptive fields:

**Free Nerve Endings:**

- **Pain (nociceptors):** Fire when tissue damage occurring or imminent
- **Temperature:** Separate receptors for heat and cold

**Specialized Receptors:**

- **Merkel cells:** Fine touch, in stratum basale (just beneath epidermis)
- **Meissner's corpuscles:** Fine touch and vibration (dermis)
- **Pacinian corpuscles:** Deep pressure and vibration (dermis)

**Distribution:** Some body areas more sensitive (fingertips, lips) due to higher receptor density and smaller receptive fields

### **3. HOMEOSTATIC FUNCTIONS**

- **Thermoregulation:** Via sweat production and blood flow changes
- **Vitamin D synthesis:** In keratinocytes (7-dehydrocholesterol → vitamin D3 via UV-B)
- **Immune surveillance:** Via Langerhans cells
- **Fluid balance:** Prevention of transepidermal water loss

## KEY CLINICAL TAKE-HOMES

1. **Filaggrin mutations** → Think: Eczema + Asthma + Ichthyosis
2. **Collagen VII defects** → Blistering (Epidermolysis Bullosa)
3. **Burns** → Fluid loss + Infection risk
4. **Melanin** → Photoprotection (more melanin = less skin cancer)
5. **Elderly skin** → Flattened rete ridges = more fragile
6. **Skin ligaments** → Consider in surgical planning
