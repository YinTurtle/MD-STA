Immunology is the study of how the body defends itself from infection and disease.  
Your immune system is made up of **two interconnected arms** — _innate_ and _adaptive immunity_ — working together to protect against foreign invaders (pathogens), while ideally avoiding attacking self-tissues.

## 🧱 1. The Two Arms of Immunity

|Feature|**Innate Immunity**|**Adaptive Immunity**|
|---|---|---|
|**Response time**|Immediate (minutes–hours)|Slower to start (days)|
|**Specificity**|Non-specific; same response to all pathogens|Highly specific to particular antigens|
|**Memory**|None (response is same every time)|Memory cells remember pathogens, giving faster, stronger response next time|
|**Components**|Physical barriers, phagocytes, complement, interferons, NK cells|T and B lymphocytes, antibodies|
|**Example**|Inflammation from a cut|Immunity after vaccination|

🧠 **Key idea:** The innate system is like **security guards** who respond to any disturbance; the adaptive system is like **detectives and snipers** — slower but highly targeted and able to “remember” the culprit.

## 🧍‍♀️ 2. Innate Immune Defences

### (a) Physical and Mechanical Barriers

- **Skin** – forms a physical wall; tough keratin resists microbes.
    
- **Mucosal surfaces** – respiratory, gut, urogenital tracts lined with mucus to trap microbes.
    
- **Cilia** – hair-like projections that move mucus upward (e.g., in the lungs).
    
- **Tears, saliva, urine** – wash away potential pathogens.
    

💡 **Clinical link:** In cystic fibrosis, thick sticky mucus and defective ciliary clearance → chronic infections.

---

### (b) Biochemical Barriers

- **Low pH:**
    
    - _Stomach acid_ (pH 2) kills most bacteria.
        
    - _Vaginal secretions_ and _sweat_ are acidic, inhibiting bacterial growth.
        
- **Lysozyme:** Enzyme in tears, saliva, and mucus — breaks down bacterial cell walls (especially Gram-positive bacteria).
    
- **Defensins:** Small antimicrobial peptides that punch holes in microbial membranes.
    

---

### (c) Phagocytic Cells

Phagocytes are cells that “eat” pathogens.

- **Neutrophils:** First responders; short-lived, abundant in pus.
    
- **Monocytes:** Circulate in blood → enter tissues → become **macrophages**.
    
- **Macrophages:** Long-lived, tissue-resident cells that engulf pathogens and release cytokines to alert other immune cells.
    

🧠 **Remember:**

- Neutrophils = _acute responders_ (fast, die young).
    
- Macrophages = _long-term defenders_ (slow, persistent).
    

---

### (d) Chemotaxis and Opsonization

- **Chemotaxis:** Movement of immune cells toward the site of infection, guided by chemical signals (e.g., cytokines, complement fragments).
    
- **Opsonins:** Molecules (like antibodies or complement proteins) that coat a pathogen, making it easier for phagocytes to recognize and engulf it.
    

🧩 **Analogy:**  
Opsonins act like “seasoning” on a pathogen — they make it more “tasty” to phagocytes!

---

### (e) Chemical Defences

|Substance|Function|
|---|---|
|**Acute Phase Proteins**|Increase during infection (e.g., CRP, fibrinogen); opsonize microbes and activate complement.|
|**Complement System**|Group of plasma proteins that enhance inflammation, opsonization, and can directly lyse pathogens.|
|**Interferons (IFN)**|Released by virus-infected cells; signal nearby cells to produce antiviral proteins.|
|**Cytokines**|Signalling proteins that coordinate immune responses (e.g., IL-1, TNF, IL-6).|

---

## 🦠 3. Interferons – The Body’s Antiviral Alarm

**Interferons (IFNs)** are key to fighting viral infections.

|Type|Produced by|Function|
|---|---|---|
|**IFN-α**|Leukocytes|Inhibit viral replication|
|**IFN-β**|Fibroblasts|Increase antiviral defences|
|**IFN-γ**|T cells, NK cells|Activates macrophages, boosts adaptive immunity|

🧠 **Mechanism:**  
When a cell is infected by a virus, it secretes IFN-α and IFN-β → nearby cells enter an “antiviral state,” blocking viral replication.

💡 **Clinical link:** Interferon therapy (e.g., IFN-α) used for chronic hepatitis B/C and some cancers.

---

## 🧩 4. Adaptive Immunity

Once the innate system detects invaders, it activates the **adaptive immune system**, which provides **specific**, **long-lasting** protection.

### (a) The Key Players

|Cell Type|Function|
|---|---|
|**B cells**|Produce antibodies (humoral immunity)|
|**T cells**|Direct cell-mediated responses and help regulate B cells|
|**NK cells**|Kill virus-infected or cancerous cells (bridge between innate and adaptive)|

---

### (b) Antigens and Antibodies

- **Antigen:** Any substance that triggers an immune response (usually foreign proteins).
    
- **Antibody (Immunoglobulin):** Y-shaped protein made by plasma cells that specifically binds to an antigen.
    

🧠 **Mnemonic:**  
“AntiGENs are what GENerate AntiBODYs.”

#### Functions of Antibodies:

- Neutralize pathogens (block binding sites).
    
- Opsonize pathogens (make them easier to phagocytose).
    
- Activate complement.
    
- Mediate cytotoxicity (via NK cells).
    

---

### (c) Primary vs. Secondary Immune Responses

When the body encounters an antigen for the first time:

- **Primary response:**
    
    - Slow (takes days to build up).
        
    - Mediated by **IgM** initially.
        
    - Produces some memory cells.
        

When exposed again:

- **Secondary response:**
    
    - Rapid and stronger.
        
    - Mediated by **IgG** (higher affinity).
        
    - Due to memory B and T cells.
        

📈 **Graph summary:**

`IgM → first peak (primary) IgG → larger, faster second peak (secondary)`

💡 **Clinical relevance:** Vaccines mimic primary exposure to build memory — so the real infection triggers an immediate, strong secondary response.

---

### (d) Plasma Cells

- **Activated B cells** that secrete large amounts of antibody.
    
- Short-lived but can produce thousands of antibody molecules per second.
    

🧠 **Analogy:** Plasma cells are “factories” churning out custom-made missiles (antibodies) against a target antigen.

## 💢 5. When the Immune System Goes Wrong

### (a) Autoimmunity

**Definition:** The immune system attacks “self” tissues due to a **loss of tolerance** (failure to distinguish self from non-self).

#### Mechanisms:

- Production of **autoantibodies** against self-antigens.
    
- **T cell–mediated** attack on self tissues.
    

#### Examples:

|Disease|Mechanism|Key Target|
|---|---|---|
|**Rheumatoid arthritis**|Autoantibody and T-cell inflammation|Synovial joints|
|**Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (IDDM)**|Autoantibodies destroy pancreatic β-cells|Insulin-producing cells|
|**Hashimoto’s thyroiditis / Graves’ disease**|Autoantibodies against thyroid antigens|Thyroid gland|

💡 **Key concept:** Autoimmune diseases can be _organ-specific_ (e.g. T1DM, thyroiditis) or _systemic_ (e.g. lupus).

---

### (b) Hormonal Influence on Immunity

- **Oestrogens** stimulate production of **IgG** and **IgA** antibodies.
    
- This may partly explain why autoimmune diseases are more common in women.
