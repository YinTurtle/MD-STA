### LO
- Describe the layers and compartments of the Palm
- Describe the long and short tendons in the hand (Sheaths, extensor hood)
- Describe Thenar, Hypothenar and intrinsic muscles of the hand (attachments, innervation function)
- Compare the effects of different nerve lesions in the hand and forearm (motor and sensory loss as well as clinical appearance and tests)

Dorsal skin is highly mobile.
- Dermis thins with age and also with steroid therapy - tear easily in elderly patient
- Thick hypodermis, thin dermis
![[Pasted image 20260205151434.png]]

Palmar skin is immobile and fixed.
- Thin hypodermis, thick dermis
![[Pasted image 20260205151513.png]]
Swelling and bruising are easily seen on the dorsal surface

### Palmar Fascia
- Superficial transverse ligament
- Deep transverse ligament
- Palmar aponeurosis
	- Thickens and contracts in Dupuytren's disease
![[Pasted image 20260205151601.png]]

### Radiocarpal and Ulnocarpal joint
![[Pasted image 20260205151816.png|200]]
![[Pasted image 20260205151834.png|200]]

2 depressions; The scaphoid facet/fossa and lunate facet/fossa

### Carpo Metacarpal Joint (CMCJs)
![[Pasted image 20260205152316.png|200]]

### Metacarpo Phalangeal Joint (MCPJs)
![[Pasted image 20260205152512.png]]
In the MCP joints, the collateral ligaments are tight in flexion and loose in extension (which is another reason why the fingertips cannot be ABDUCTED as they flex - fist shape)

### Ulnar Collateral Ligament (UCL)
![[Pasted image 20260205152738.png|300]]
![[Pasted image 20260205152752.png]]

### Proximal Inter Phalangeal Joint (PIPJs)
![[Pasted image 20260205152838.png]]
![[Pasted image 20260205152857.png]]
In interphalangeal joints (proximal and distal)
- Tight in Extension
- Slack in Flexion

### Distal Inter Phalangeal Joint (DIPJs)
![[Pasted image 20260205152956.png]]
Have much softer volar plates.
- This allows greater pulp-to-pulp surface area contract when pinching delivering greater areas of sensory tissue towards each other

### Muscles
##### Extrinsic
Start in forearm, finish in the hand
- Extrinsic finger flexor tendons leave the forearm and enter the hand through the carpal tunnel
##### Intrinsic
Start and finish in the hand

### Carpal Tunnel
![[Pasted image 20260205153159.png]]
![[Pasted image 20260205153216.png]]
[The yellow is the carpal tunnel]

![[Pasted image 20260205153249.png]]
Contents of the Carpal Tunnel
- Median nerve
- FDP tendons
- FDS tendons
- FPL tendon

### Flexor Tendons
![[Pasted image 20260205153336.png|300]]
FDP flexes [[Hand and wrist#Distal Inter Phalangeal Joint (DIPJs)]]
FDS flexes [[Hand and wrist#Proximal Inter Phalangeal Joint (PIPJs)]]

### Flexor Sheath
![[Pasted image 20260205153528.png]]
Cruciate pulleys maintain integrity of the flexor sheath and permit shortening/lengthening

![[Pasted image 20260205153611.png]]
Annular pulleys are necessary to prevent bowstringing and to maximise tendon mechanics

![[Pasted image 20260205153716.png]]![[Pasted image 20260205153751.png]]![[Pasted image 20260205153819.png]]
The extensor tendon is like a cloak that drapes across the back of the phalanges.
There is a central thickening called the 'Central Slip' (pink)
There are thickening at each edge called the lateral slips (blue)

![[Pasted image 20260205153901.png]]

If central slip tears PIPJ droops and **Boutonniere Deformity** occurs
![[Pasted image 20260205154013.png|200]]
If lateral slips tear, the DIPJ droops, creating a mallet finger deformity
![[Pasted image 20260205154024.png|200]]

The tear in the central slip allows the head of the proximal phalanx through

### Extensor Pollicis Longus (EPL)
![[Pasted image 20260205154200.png]]

Lifting the thumb off the table is called retropulsion
![[Pasted image 20260205154217.png]]
This action can only be performed by EPL

Loss of retropulsion = Loss of EPL function

![[Pasted image 20260205154519.png]]

![[Pasted image 20260205154528.png]]

The extrinsic extensors extend the MCPJs
![[Pasted image 20260205154602.png]]

The lumbrical muscles flex the MCPJs and extend the IPJs
![[Pasted image 20260205154627.png]]

### Compartments of the palm
- Thenar
- Hypothenar
- Adductor
- Midpalmar
- Interosseous
### Intrinsic muscles
##### Thenar
![[Pasted image 20260205164018.png]]
###### Abductor Pollicis Brevis (APB)
- APB originates from the flexor retinaculum, the tubercle of the scaphoid and the trapezium. It inserts into the lateral side of the proximal phalanx.
- Moves the thumb **away from** the palm
- Wasting of the APB muscle due to compression of the median nerve at the carpal tunnel (carpal tunnel syndrome)
###### Flexor Pollicis Brevis (FPB)
- The superficial head of FPB originates from the flexor retinaculum and the tubercle of the trapezium, inserting into the base of the proximal phalanx of the thumb
- The deep head of FPB originates from the trapezoid and capitate bones, joining the tendon of the superficial head to insert on the proximal phalanx
- Flexes the MCPJ (not the IPJ) of the thumb
###### Opponens Pollicis
- The opponens pollicis is a small triangular muscle that originates from the flexor retinaculum and the trapezium, inserting on to the distal neck of the thumb metacarpal
- Abducts, flexes and rotates the thumb metacarpal

##### Simian crease
Single palmar crease
![[Pasted image 20260205165657.png|200]]
Frequently used by paediatricians to diagnose Down's Syndrome
##### Hypothenar
![[Pasted image 20260205165758.png|200]]
###### Abductor Digiti Minimi (ADM)
- ADM originates on the PISIFORM and FLEXOR RETINACULUM and inserts on the ABDUCTOR TUBERCLE at the ulnar base of the proximal phalanx
	![[Pasted image 20260205170145.png|250]]
###### Flexor Digiti Minimi (FDM)
- FDM originates from the HOOK OF THE HAMATE and the FLEXOR RETINACULUM and FCU tendon and inserts at the base of the little finger proximal phalanx
	![[Pasted image 20260205170246.png|250]]
###### Opponens Digiti Minimi (ODM)
- ODQ originates from the HOOK OF THE HAMATE and the FLEXOR RETINACULUM and inserts on to the RADIAL BORDER OF THE LITTLE METACARPAL
	![[Pasted image 20260205170321.png|250]]
##### Adductor
###### Adductor Pollicis
- The adductor pollicis is a flat, fan-shaped muscle that has two heads; the transverse head originating from the middle metacarpal and inserting onto the thumb metacarpal
- And the OBLIQUE head originating from the capitate bone, the shafts of the index and middle metacarpals, and the sheath of the FCR
	![[Pasted image 20260205170432.png|300]]
##### Others
###### Interossei
![[Pasted image 20260205170602.png|250]]

Palmar Adduct (PAD) the fingers
![[Pasted image 20260205170612.png|200]]
Dorsal Abduct (DAB) the fingers
![[Pasted image 20260205170622.png|200]]
##### Lumbricals
- The lumbrical muscles have NO BONY attachments
- They ORIGINATE from the deep flexor tendons and INSERT into the extensor hood
- The lumbrical muscles Flex the MCPJs and Extend the IPJs

![[Pasted image 20260205154940.png]]

### Nerves
- Median
- Ulnar
- Radial
##### Median
- Mixed nerve – motor and sensory fibres (efferent and afferent)
- MOTOR supplies the thenar muscles (via the RECURRENT BRANCH) and lateral two lumbricals
- This branch leaves the main trunk AFTER passing through the carpal tunnel
![[Pasted image 20260205155052.png]]
- The digital nerves provide sensation to (usually) the radial three and a half digits
![[Pasted image 20260205155134.png]]

![[Pasted image 20260205155156.png]]
In carpal tunnel syndrome, patients report NORMAL sensation over the thenar eminence but ABNORMAL sensation in the lateral 3 ½ digits, together with WEAKNESS of the thenar muscles

###### Clinical testing of the Median nerve
![[Pasted image 20260205155300.png|200]]

##### Ulnar
- Mixed nerve – motor and sensory fibres (efferent and afferent)
- The main trunk divides into DEEP (motor) and SUPERFICIAL (sensory) branches as it enters the hand
![[Pasted image 20260205155423.png]]
![[Pasted image 20260205155438.png]]
###### Nerve palsy/injury
Normally, if a nerve palsy occurs high in the arm, a GREATER disability occurs than when the palsy occurs in its lower course

A proximal (‘high’) palsy to the median nerve will result in a greater loss of function than a distal (‘low’) palsy
![[Pasted image 20260205155657.png]]
![[Pasted image 20260205155713.png]]

![[Pasted image 20260205155820.png]]

In ulnar nerve palsy:
![[Pasted image 20260205155925.png]]
![[Pasted image 20260205155939.png]]
![[Pasted image 20260205155953.png]]

High ulnar nerve palsy
- Numb medial 1 1/2 digits
- Hyperextended [[Hand and wrist#Metacarpo Phalangeal Joint (MCPJs)]]
Low ulnar nerve palsy
- Numb and flexed (clawed) posture medial 1 1/2 digits
![[Pasted image 20260205160128.png]]
###### Ulnar Paradox
The higher the lesion, the lesser the deformity
![[Pasted image 20260205160655.png]]

###### Clinical testing of Ulnar Nerve
![[Pasted image 20260205160849.png|200]]
- Lesions proximal to the wrist present with altered sensation on both dorsal and palmar sides.
- Lesions distal to the wrist present with altered sensation only on the palmar side
![[Pasted image 20260205171212.png|200]]
- Weakness of the FDIO

###### Froment's test
Negative
![[Pasted image 20260205171454.png|300]]

Positive
![[Pasted image 20260205171812.png|300]]

###### Strength of Palmar Interossei (PAD)
![[Pasted image 20260205171920.png|300]]
Insert a paper in between each digits (except thumb) and pull to see if patient can hold on

###### Activity of Interossei
![[Pasted image 20260205172040.png|300]]
Assess the activity of interossei by repeatedly crossing fingers of each digits (except thumb)

##### Radial
- Purely SENSORY nerve in the hand
- Sensation to the dorsal aspect of the First web space and dorsum of index and long fingers (blue)
![[Pasted image 20260205172250.png|200]]
- Sensation provided through the radial sensory nerve
- Branch of the radial nerve that originates at the elbow
- Runs to the wrist deep to brachioradialis
- Vulnerable to pressure from wrist watch ([[Hand and wrist#Wartenburg's Syndrome]])
###### Wartenburg's Syndrome
A rare compression neuropathy of the superficial radial nerve in the forearm or wrist, resulting in pain, numbness, and tingling on the back of the hand without motor weakness

##### Vascular
###### Superficial palmar arch
![[Pasted image 20260205172621.png|400]]
Each digit has a dominant digital artery.
- These dominant arteries are always the artery closest to the **middle finger**

###### Deep palmar arch
![[Pasted image 20260205172709.png|400]]
### Anatomy Structure of (one side) hand, wrist, upper limb
- **19 Tubular Bones (Long/Short Bones):** These include the 5 metacarpals (palm bones) and 14 phalanges (finger bones).
- **8 Irregular Bones (Carpal Bones):** These form the carpus (wrist): scaphoid, lunate, triquetrum, pisiform, trapezium, trapezoid, capitate, and hamate.
- **19 Joints:** This includes the joints within the hand and fingers, specifically:
	- metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints (5)
	- proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints (4)
	- distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints (4)
	- interphalangeal joint of the thumb (1)
	- and carpometacarpal (CMC) joints
- **19 Intrinsic Muscles:** These are the small muscles located entirely within the hand responsible for fine motor movements.
- **1 Wrist (Carpus):** The joint complex connecting the hand to the forearm.
- **1 Elbow:** The joint connecting the forearm to the upper arm.
- **1 Shoulder:** The joint connecting the upper limb to the axial skeleton.

[Together, these structures (27 bones in the hand/wrist + 3 in the arm/shoulder) form the appendicular skeleton of one upper extremity.]
