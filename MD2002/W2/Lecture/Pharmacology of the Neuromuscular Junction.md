#pharmacology #nerves/neurotransmitters 

### LO
- To recall named examples of agents that can block neuromuscular junction neurotransmission and to relate this to how they block transmission
- To explain the mechanism of action of both depolarising and non-depolarising neuromuscular junction blocking agents
- To identify the main side effects of neuromuscular blocking agents and anticholinesterases
- To explain how recovery from neuromuscular block occurs and this can be induced

### Blocking Neuromuscular Transmission:
**Presynaptically**, by inhibiting ACh synthesis in the neuron
- Rate-limiting step is choline uptake
**Presynaptically**, by inhibiting ACh release from the neuron
- Prevent fusion of vesicles and release of neurotransmitter
**Postsynaptically**, by preventing the effects of ACh on muscle
- By interfering with the actions of ACh on its target receptor

### Inhibiting ACh release
- Local anaesthetics
- General inhalational anaesthetics
- Inhibitors/competitors of calcium
	- Mg ions
	- Some antibiotics (e.g. tetracycline)
- Neurotoxins
	- Botulinum (from clostridium botulinum) - botox
		- Can also be used for muscle spasticity - also a treatment for hyperhydrosis (botox inhibits ACh release - ACh triggers swear glands -> inhibition stops excessive sweating)
	- β-Bungarotoxin (from snakes) - inhibits ACh release

### Clinical uses of neuromuscular-blocking drugs
- Endotracheal intubation
- During surgical procedures
	- To allow surgical access to abdominal cavity
	- To ensure immobility (e.g. prevent cough during head and neck surgery)
	- Allow relaxation to reduce displaced fracture or dislocation
	- During electroconvulsive therapy - so the muscles aren't twitching

### Postsynaptic blockade
- Nicotinic ACh receptor
	- Activated by 2 ACh molecules binding to it -> opens up to allow Na to enter and K to go out - depolarisation
- Receptors
	- Agonists - something that activates the receptor - causing it to open
		- Nicotine, suxamethonium, ACh
	- Antagonist - competitive, keeps receptor from being bound
		- Tubocurarine, Atracurium

### Non-depolarising blockers
- Competitive antagonists of Nicotinic ACh receptors at the NMJ
	- e.g. atracurium, mivacurium, pancuronium, vecuronium, rocuronium
- They bind where ACh would bind, and prevent ACh binding to that receptor, therefore the ACh can't cause those receptors to open, therefore you don't get the same depolarisation at the end plate, therefore no depolarisation of the membrane.

### Depolarising blockers
**Agonists** of Nicotinic ACh receptors at the neuromuscular junction.
- e.g. suxamethonium
- not metabolised by Acethylcholine esterase

First you get muscle contraction (fasciculations)
After initial contraction, you can't cause the muscle to contract again until all of the drug is out of the system.
ACh is rapidly degraded by Acetylcholine esterase. But suxamethonium is not readily metabolised by acethylcholine esterase. Because of that, it cant reset.

![[Pasted image 20260223173549.png]]Nicotinic Acethylcholine receptors at the end plate that is constantly being held open by  suxamethonium. The rest of the voltage gated sodium channels are unable to reset to start the next wave of electrical activity due to the blockage.

#### Depolarising block can occur in 2 phases
**Phase 1** (predictable in terms of length)
- muscle fasciculation observed, then contraction blocked
- Repolarisation inhibited by open nicotinic ACh receptors
	- K+ leaks from cells (hyperkalemia)
- Voltage-gated sodium channels kept inactivated

**Phase 2**
- prolonged/increased exposure to drug
- "desensitisation blockade"
	- depolarisation cannot occur, even in absence of drug
	- will eventually wear off

### Neuromuscular blocking drugs
Different onset and duration allow selection by required function:
e.g. fast fast acting for rapid intubation

**Side-effects**
- Some directly related to mechanism of action (e.g. suxamethonium causing myalgia)
- Some may be due to the drug binding to other similar, receptor types (e.g. tachycardia)

#### Metabolism and elimination of NMJ blockers
**Ester hydrolysis and Hofmann elimination
- atracurium
**Plasma cholinesterases**
(vary for different people, most people wears off very fast, lasts for hours in others)
- mivacurium
- suxamethonium
**Hepatic metabolism**
(don't use in patients with bad liver)
- pancuronium
- vecuronium
**Unchanged in bile/urine**
- rocuronium

### Cholinesterases
Suxamethonium is not degraded by ACh.E, but by plasma cholinesterase.
If both ACh.E and plasma cholinesterase, you would stop the degradation of ACh. That would mean any ACh released from motor neuron, would accumulate at the NMJ and would compete with non-depolarising blockers that are bound to nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. This would increase the probability to displace the non-depolarising blockers to open the receptor. 

> [!info] Summary
> Basically accumulate ACh as much as possible in synaptic region by preventing its degradation. Then would compete for the binding of the non-depolarising blockers to restore transmission.

### Anticholinesterase drugs
Types of cholinesterase
- Acetylcholinesterase (ACh.E)
	- true cholinesterase - specific for hydrosis of ACh
	- Present in the conducting tissue as well as RBC's
	- Bound to the basal lamina in the synaptic cleft
- Plasma cholinesterases
	- pseudocholinesterase - acts on a broad spectrum of substrates
	- soluble in plasma and is found everywhere

Inhibitors of cholinesesterase enzymes
- irreversible - not clinically used - completely inactivates the enzyme
	- can be rescued by pralidoxime if delivered early
- reversible - very slowly hydrolysed
- organophosphates used in herbicides

Anticholinesterase drugs are all inhibitors of cholinesterase enzymes
- Increase availability of ACh at NMJ by decreasing its degradation.
- Increase duration of activity of ACh at NMJ
- So more ACh to compete with non-depolarising blockers

Side effects of anticholinesterases
- CNS
	- Initial excitation with convulsions
	- Unconsciousness and respiratory failure
- ANS
	- **S**alivation
	- **L**acrimation
	- **U**rination
	- **D**efecation
	- **G**astrointestinal upset
	- **E**mesis
	- bradycardia
	- hypotension
	- bronchoconstriction
	- pupillary constriction (miosis)
	basically anything that is wear and tear-able

### Clinical uses of anticholinesterases
**In anaesthesia**
- reverse non-depolarising muscle blockade (except *mivacurium*)
- given with atropine or glycopyrrolate to counteract parasympathetic effects

**Myasthenia Gravis**
- increase neuromuscular transmission

**Glaucoma**
- decrease intraocular pressure

**Alzheimer's disease**
- enhance the cholinergic transmission in the CNS

#### Myasthenia gravis
Autoantibodies may be produced against the ACh receptor blocking the interaction of the receptor with its ligand (ACh) and leading to increased muscle weakness and death.

Basically an autoantibody that bind to nicotinic ACh receptor at NMJ and move some to cause depolarisation. They work by increase ACh released, stay at NMJ to increase probability that ACh can bind to the receptor that isn't inhibited by the antibody.

### Others
**Sugammadex** can rapidly reverse the effects of **rocuronium** and **vecuronium**.
