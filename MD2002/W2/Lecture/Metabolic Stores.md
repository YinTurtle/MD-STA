### LO
- Describe the importance of catabolic-anabolic homeostasis and the interconversion of fuels in the absorptive and postabsorptive state
- Define the terms: glycogenesis; glycogenolysis; gluconeogenesis
- Describe lipogenesis, lipolysis including beta-oxidation and their role in cellular metabolism
- Explain the relevance of transamination & deamination of amino acids in cellular metabolism
- Link the diverse activities of the liver with its role in energy metabolism

### Catabolic-Anabolic Balance
##### Metabolism
Mechanisms which couple the demand for energy (which is constant), with the fuel supply (irregular pattern)
##### Absorptive/fed state
Nutrients are plentiful - fuels broken down and excess stored (anabolism)
**Insulin** promotes:
- Glucose uptake
- Fatty acid synthesis
- Protein synthesis
##### Postabsorptive/fasting state
Storage molecules broken down for energy (catabolism) - biosynthesis slows down

### Absorptive/Fed State
![[Pasted image 20260205131311.png]]
To store nutrients in mobilizable form, when needed

### Postabsorptive/Fasting State
![[Pasted image 20260205131349.png]]
To provide metabolites for cellular respiration and ATP synthesis. Ultimately, to save enough glucose for the brain to utilise.

### Interconversion of Fuels
- Metabolic storage molecules are interconvertible as their pathways are linked by key intermediates
- Effector organs controlling release of, or interconversion are
	- Liver
	- Adipose
	- Muscle
- Mobilisation of glucose, triglycerides and amino acids
![[Pasted image 20260205131721.png]]

### Goal of Postabsorptive State
- Primary aim:
	- Maintain blood glucose of 70/100mg/dl, or 4-7mmol/L
![[Pasted image 20260205131812.png]]

Blood glucose come from:
##### Glycogenolysis
- Liver glycogen ~100g (~3-5 hours of activity)
- Muscle glycogen (only can be used within muscles - so not other tissues)
##### Gluconeogenesis
Formation of glucose from noncarbohydrate molecules
- Occurs mainly in the liver
- Lipolysis of triglycerides to generate glycerol -> glucose
- Muscle protein can be used as energy - deamination of amino acids -> glucose

### Glycogen
- A branched polysaccharide storage molecule for glucose
- **Liver and skeletal muscle are the main glycogen reservoirs**
- Liver: maintains blood glucose levels
	- Enough glycogen for 3-5 hours moderate exercise or 12 hours overnight fast
- Muscle: stores glycogen for muscle contraction only - meaning it is not released into the bloodstream
- Glycogen stores change constantly, with changes in nutrition status
![[Pasted image 20260205132324.png]]


### Glycogen Metabolism
- Glycogenesis: promoted by insulin
- Glucose → G-6-P → G-1-P → Glycogen
- Glucose residues formed by α1,4-glycosidic linkages
- Branching occurs via α1,6-glycosidic linkages
- Glycogenolysis: promoted by glucagon, adrenalin, cortisol and growth hormone
- In muscle, no glucagon receptors – responds mainly to adrenalin
- Two enzymes required
	- Glycogen phosphorylase - α1,4 linkages
	- Debranching enzyme – α1,6 linkages

### Glycogenolysis/Glycogen Breakdown
##### In the liver
Glycogen → G-1-P → G-6-P → Glucose
- Released into bloodstream (Glut2), for uptake by all cells, but especially brain & RBCs
##### In muscle
- No G-6-Pase enzyme, G-6-P enters glycolysis

### Different Fuels
- Due to limited supply of glycogen (3-5 hours), other fuel sources must be used
- Lipids are the major form in which energy is stored

### Gluconeogenesis
Takes place mainly in liver (also in kidneys in prolonged fasting)
Formation of glucose from non-carbohydrate sources
- Glycerol from triglycerides
- Glucogenic amino acids (e.g. alanine and glutamine)
- Lactate
Tissues whose primary source of energy is glucose:
- Brain
- RBC
- Renal medulla
- Lens
![[Pasted image 20260205133048.png]]

### Lipids
- Free fatty acids, majority forming triglycerides (aka triacylglycerols)
- Cholesterol
- Phospholipids
- Functions:
	- Fuel source
	- Formation of membranes
	- Steroid hormone and prostaglandins synthesis
	- Solubilisation of non-polar substances in body fluids
	- Lung surfactant
- Triglyceride
	- Condensation of glycerol and 3 fatty acids (esterification)
![[Pasted image 20260205133313.png]]

### Lipoproteins: Chylomicrons
- Dietary derived fats are absorbed in the intestines, assembled with apolipoproteins to form ‘chylomicrons’ - circulate to tissues
- Fatty acids are taken up by cells (muscle & adipose) expressing lipoprotein lipase which hydrolyses TAGs. FFA then diffuse through cell membranes
- The liver removes remnant chylomicrons and synthesises new lipoproteins to transport de novo cholesterol, phospholipids & fatty acids to cells
![[Pasted image 20260205133408.png]]

### Lipoprotein Classes
Vary in size and density based on ratio of lipid:protein
- Chylomicrons - least dense and largest
- Very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) – synthesised continually in the liver
	- Exports TAGs to muscle and adipose
	- VLDL become intermediate density lipoproteins IDL once most TAGs removed
- Low density lipoprotein (LDL) – depleted of TAGs
	- Consists mainly of cholesterol
- High density lipoprotein (HDL) – smallest in size
	- Rich in cholesterol esters
	- Important for delivering cholesterol to cells & steroid hormone producing glands (e.g. adrenal, ovary, testes)
![[Pasted image 20260205133546.png]]

### Lipolysis
Hydrolysis of triglycerides into glycerol and free fatty acid (FFA)
- Liver metabolises FFA and glycerol
- Glycerol feeds into [[Metabolic Stores#Gluconeogenesis]] but can also be utilised by most cells
	- Converted into glyceraldehyde-3- phosphate → glycolysis (½ glucose = 15 ATP aerobically)
- Fatty acid chains undergo β-oxidation
	- Broken down into 2-carbon acetic acid and fused to Coenzyme A → acetyl-CoA
	- FAD and NAD+ reduced → feed into electron transport chain
	- Acetyl-CoA → citric acid cycle
![[Pasted image 20260205133828.png]]

### Lipolysis and Ketone Bodies
- When carbohydrate intake is low and β-oxidation product acetyl-CoA in excess (for citric acid cycle to metabolise), **ketone bodies** are formed
- Oxaloacetate is the limiting factor when glucose low, as converted to pyruvate in gluconeogenesis
- Acetyl-CoA converted to ketone bodies (liver)
	- Acetoacetate
	- 3-hydroxybutyrate
	- Acetone
- Ketone bodies can be used to generate ATP

[In diabetes acetoacetate produced faster than metabolised – ketone bodies accumulate in blood (potential acidosis) and fruity smell of acetone on breath]

### Protein Metabolism
- Excess protein cannot be stored - used for normal cellular turnover
##### Other key roles of protein include
- In fasting & starvation, amino acids are source of metabolic energy via **transamination** – conversion to keto acids
- Form precursors of lipids and ketones
- Amino acids carbon skeletons form essential biomolecules (e.g. nucleotides, haem etc.)
- Carbon skeleton precursors of neurotransmitters, hormones (e.g. thyroxine, melanin, adrenalin etc.)
##### Transamination
Transfer of amine group (NH2) to α-ketoglutarate → glutamic acid (glutamate)
[Moving an amine group to a ketone]

##### Deamination
Removal of the amino group and regeneration of α-ketoglutarate (keto-acid)
[Removal of said amino group from a keto-acid]

- Excess NH3 is removed by conversion to urea
![[Pasted image 20260205134444.png]]

### Amino Acid Metabolism
- Amino acids undergoing transamination can be further modified to produce:
	- Intermediates for the citric acid cycle (e.g. oxaloacetate, succinyl-CoA, pyruvate)
	- Glucose via gluconeogenesis
- There are 20 amino acids: 10 essential and 10 non-essential amino acids, of which some are glucogenic or ketogenic, or both:
##### Glucogenic
Form glucose and citric acid intermediates
- Alanine; cysteine; glycine; serine; threonine → glucose via gluconeogenesis
- Asparagine; aspartate → oxaloacetate
- Glutamine; glutamate; histidine; proline → α-ketoglutarate
- Isoleucine; methionine; valine → succinyl-CoA
##### Ketogenic
Oxidised to form acetyl-CoA and acetoacetate → ketone bodies and lipids for energy metabolism
- Leucine and lysine
Some amino acids are both glucogenic and ketogenic:
- Isoleucine; phenylalanine; tryptophan; tyrosine; threonine

### Key Organ Energy Usage
##### Liver
- Hepatic portal system ensures liver has ready access to absorbed nutrients
- Major metabolism centre orchestrating interconversion of CHO, protein & fats, plus lactate
- Maintains blood glucose levels
##### Brain
- 60% of all glucose used by the brain ~120g day
- No stores of glycogen or glucose
- Can use ketone bodies in starvation
##### Muscles
- Resting muscle uses fatty acids as fuel, also glucose and ketone bodies
- Large glycogen reserves ¾ of body’s stores
