Vasile Popescu Scenario
19 yrs, lost control on bike in rain after finishing work
- Young age, better healing potential than older adults
- Usually lower cardiovascular risk (hypertension and atherosclerosis are less likely) due to age
	- Doesn't protect major vascular injury after trauma however
Lost control in rain and fell onto left shoulder, arm trapped under bike
- Confirmed humeral shaft fracture
	- Due to shoulder impact + left arm trapped under bike
	- High energy blunt trauma
- Being trapped under bike
	- Prolonged compression can worsen and lead to
		- Swelling, vascular issue, risk of compartment syndrome
- Neck/shoulder stretch
	- Shoulder impact (left) + traction -> risk of brachial plexus stretch injury (esp c5-c6/upper body trunk)
- Cervical spine injury risk in bike crash -> could lead to paralysis and immobilisation (if neurologically affected)
- Burns possible from hot exhaust (trapped under bike pipe?)

ABCDE
Airway
- speaking
	- airway open
Breathing
- RR 22 breaths/minute
	- Tachypnoea
	- Could be caused by pain/anxiety from physiological or psychological stress, less likely chest pathology (due to age and clinical examination checks)
- Saturation 98% on air
	- Normal range, does not rule out small pneumothorax or lung issues (but doesnt suggest it either)
	- Keep monitoring because trauma may evolve
Circulation
- HR 115/min
	- Tachycardic
	- Most likely response from pain
	- Could also be from bleeding (from trauma)
- BP 130/82
	- Relatively normal
Disability
- Adequate GCS standards
	- talking, cooperative(?)
Exposure
- Nurse cutting away clothing
	- Efficient + prevents missed injuries

Injury
- Left arm is deformed and extremely painful
	- Fracture and dislocation
- Vascular compromised
	- Urgent
	- No brachial or radial pulse, weak ulnar pulse
	- Hand is cooler, cap refill slower
		- Could likely be limb ischaemia/arterial injury
	- Brachial artery spasm, thrombosis, compression from fracture displacement or swelling, partial complete cut (transection)
- Ulnar pulse is still present probably from collateral circulation (from collateral networks)
- Cant abduct arm
	- pain-limited, deltoid/axillary nerve or proximal injury
- Cant flex arm
	- c5-c6 involvement or bicep nerve damage
- Finger movement still preserved
	- distal median/ulnar motor pathways may be intact

SBAR (forgot to mention but ill add it here anyways)
S - 19M motorbike crash, left arm trapped; severe pain + deformity; suspected fracture with threatened perfusion
B - No other known PMH/meds given; first hospital experience; anxious about cost; works in farm
A - ABC stable-ish: speaking, sats 98% RA, HR 115, BP 130/82
- Limb findings:
	- deformity
	- absent brachial/radial pulse
    - weak ulnar pulse
	- motor deficit: cannot abduct/flex; fingers move
R - Immediate review, urgent imaging and vascular assessment, prep for vascular/ortho involvement

- The longer a limb is under perfused, higher risk of irreversible tissue injury
	- 6 hours [may need to check on the time for this, i may have misheard] (golden period) for warm ischaemia before irreversible muscle necrosis
	- angiogram suggests main arterial interruption with collateral reconstitution
- Muscle death (ischaemic necrosis)
	- If revascularisation is delayed, ischaemic muscle can become non-viable, increasing risk of compartment syndrome, infection, and potentially amputation
- Neuropraxia
	- Ischaemia may be affecting nerve conduction
		- check again after swelling and ischaemia resolve
			- typically can resolve itself

Allen's test
- assess collateral circulation - patient is still able to move finger

Morphine given
- Helps pain, better exam and safer imaging
Pain ladder
- paracetamol
- weak opioid
- strong opioid
Severe acute trauma - appropriate to go to strong opioid rather slow climbing (from paracetamol)

Secondary survey
- head to toe examination after ABC
- Trauma CT rules out other internal injuries
- Xray shows humeral shaft fracture

Diagnoses (likely)
- Humeral shaft fracture
- Acute limb ischaemia due to brachial artery injury or obstruction
- Brachial plexus nerve injury

Also remember to consider compartment syndrome and burns

Clinical teamwork
- efficient
- early involvement of orthopaedics and vascular

Patient concern
- works in a farm
- partner expecting (2 months)
- shock - first time in hospital
- doesnt know about the NHS being free

After acute management
- surgery: fracture and vascular repair (if needed)
- monitoring pulse, temperature, swelling (compartment syndrome check) etc
- Reassess motor
- Rehab - physiotherapy + occupational therapy
- Psychological support if limb function loss
- Social support - financial guidance, support services

- X-ray
	- Shaft fracture
	- Brachial artery were damaged
		- Blocked
			- Severed
			- Could be caused by the deformity
				- Dislocation of the elbow joint
				- Lead to swelling around the muscle
					- Compresses the brachial artery
- MRI
	- To check what is happening with the brachial plexus after checking the bones
		- Typically vascular issues are resolved after bones are fixed from dislocation
