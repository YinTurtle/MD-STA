High density lipoproteins have the greatest proportion of protein, approx. 45-50% (and the lowest proportion of cholesterol.

Apolipoproteins are not lipoproteins, but are specialised proteins that will combine with lipids to form lipoproteins, such as chylomicrons.

Chylomicrons are the least dense and consist of approx. 1-2% protein.

Low density lipoproteins consist of approx. 25% protein.

Very low density lipoproteins consist of approx. 45-50% protein.
