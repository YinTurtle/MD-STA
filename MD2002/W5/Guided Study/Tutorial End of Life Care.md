#ethics 

### LO
- Outline what an advance directive/decision is, and some of the difficulties associated with its use in clinical medicine
- Explain why some patients might want to make an advance directive/decision
- Recognise the importance of advance care planning, and be able to argue for and against the use of advance directives/decisions using the principles of medical ethics (respect for autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, justice)

1) What is an Advance Decision?
	A document designed to enable the patient for future reference. So in the future if the patient is unable to make the decision, the patient has already made the decision in the past. Set down in advance on what their issues are.
2) What can Advance Decisions do and what are they not able to do?
	Set down the decisions verbally. Need not to be a physical object. 
3) What are the potential implications if a medical practitioner knowingly acts against an Advance Decision?
	They face severe professional, civil, and criminal repercussions. Such actions disregard a patient's legal right to refuse treatment, potentially leading to charges of battery, criminal prosecution for assault, or civil lawsuits for damages.
4) Discuss Professor Huxtable’s argument that Advance Decisions are fundamentally about respecting patient autonomy. Are other four pillars of medical ethics important? Do you agree that autonomy is the most important principle being respected by Advance Decisions?
	An ADRT protects a person’s right to make choices about their own body even when they later can’t speak for themselves. It extends self-determination across time, preventing unwanted interventions.
	Beneficence: clinicians aim to do good, but “good” must be defined with the patient’s values; ADRTs help align care with what the patient considers beneficial.
	Non-maleficence: unwanted treatment can be a harm (physical burden, indignity, prolonged suffering). Respecting an ADRT can prevent that harm.
	Justice: resources and fair allocation aren’t the main purpose of ADRTs, but they’re relevant in systems-level decisions and consistency of practice.

Next of kin may hold priority if mentioned in AD.
## Case 1
A female in her 50s has a long history of rheumatoid arthritis associated with chronic back pain and profound fatigue leaving her to be unable to leave her own home. After experiencing the deaths of two people close to her in ‘distressing circumstances’, she decided, in conjunction with her family, to have an Advance Decision created listing six conditions she would not want medical treatment for, leaving copies of her directive with her husband, sister, daughter, lawyer and GP. Related to this, she also joined a society that promoted euthanasia and obtained medications that would allow her to take an overdose. She maintained that she did not want to be admitted to intensive care in the future. Due to self-perceived worsening quality of life and a self-diagnosed minor stroke, she decided to take an overdose of a mixture of medications. She was found the following morning by her husband unconscious but still breathing with a note explaining her intended suicide. He decided to take her to Accident & Emergency (A&E) as he was concerned that even though she had not wanted to live, she may be suffering from the consequences of an unsuccessful suicide. Doctors in A&E acknowledged the Advance Decision. However, given that she had none of the conditions listed in the Advance Decision, it was decided to be appropriate to treat her. She survived to the point of discharge and lived for another year, requiring her husband and son to provide full-time care at home, before being admitted to hospital with pneumonia where she then died.

### 1) What are the patient’s perspectives on terminal care?

- She places a high value on **control and avoidance of burdensome treatment**, especially intensive care (“did not want to be admitted to ICU”).
- Her advance decision suggests she wants to **refuse treatment under certain future health states**, implying she sees some outcomes as unacceptable (loss of dignity/independence, prolonged suffering).
- Joining a euthanasia-promoting society and obtaining overdose medication suggests she views **self-determined death** as a legitimate way to avoid a life she considers intolerable.
- Her overdose after a perceived decline indicates she prioritises **quality of life over longevity**, and fears being kept alive in a state she would find distressing.

---

### 2) What difficulties does her husband face and why?

- **Emotional conflict and moral distress:** he knows she didn’t want to live, but also worries she may be **suffering** from a failed overdose; he’s torn between respecting her wishes and preventing harm.
- **Uncertainty about her current wishes:** she is unconscious - he can’t check whether she would still endorse refusal in _this exact scenario_ (overdose consequences vs terminal disease).
- **Legal/ethical pressure:** he must act without being fully sure what is legally binding, and may fear guilt, blame, or regret whichever choice he makes.
- **Carer burden after survival:** she lived another year needing full-time care, creating major **physical, financial, and psychological strain** on him and their son.
- **Grief/trauma layering:** the “distressing deaths” she witnessed and then her attempted suicide can compound his distress and complicate bereavement.

---

### 3) What dilemmas do healthcare staff face when she presents to hospital?

- **Validity/applicability dilemma:** they acknowledge the advance decision, but she doesn’t have the six listed conditions - so is the directive **applicable** to an overdose situation? If not, they may be obliged to treat.
- **Autonomy vs best interests:** she left a note stating suicidal intent, but that’s not automatically a legally binding refusal of emergency care; staff must balance respecting autonomy with the duty to preserve life and relieve suffering.
- **Self-harm context:** clinicians may worry about reinforcing self-harm if they withhold treatment, and they must consider mental capacity issues around self-harm/possible depression.
- **Family disagreement potential:** husband brought her in; other relatives may interpret her wishes differently; staff must manage conflict while acting lawfully and ethically.
- **Resource and proportionality judgments:** even if treatment is possible, staff must decide what is proportionate (e.g., ICU escalation) given her stated ICU refusal and overall context.

---

### 4) Potential challenges surrounding Advance Decisions shown by this case

- **Narrow or conditional wording:** the directive lists specific conditions; real-life scenarios (like overdose) may fall outside the listed triggers, making it **hard to apply** even when it seems aligned with the person’s overall values.
- **Predicting future situations is hard:** people often can’t anticipate every relevant circumstance or how they’ll feel when it happens.
- **Ambiguity between “refuse ICU” vs “refuse all treatment”:** she didn’t want ICU, but did she refuse non-ICU life-saving treatment after overdose? The directive may not answer that.
- **Capacity and contemporaneous intent:** an advance decision is made when capacitated, but an overdose note reflects an acute decision that might or might not be judged capacitated; staff may struggle with how much weight to give it.
- **Family interpretation and conflict:** multiple copies and “in conjunction with family” can help communication, but can also create **different interpretations** of what she meant.
- **Clinician fear of legal consequences:** even if clinicians sympathise with her stated wishes, if the directive is not clearly applicable, they may treat to avoid acting unlawfully.
- **Moral distress and downstream consequences:** the case shows that “treating because the ADRT wasn’t applicable” can lead to prolonged survival with heavy dependence, raising difficult questions about whether the outcome aligned with her values.
- **Interface with assisted dying law:** her membership in a euthanasia society and obtaining overdose meds highlights a gap between what some patients want and what is legally permitted, which can complicate planning discussions.

## Case 2
Clinically assisted (“artificial”) hydration and nutrition refers to the process by which fluids are given via a cannula (intravenous or subcutaneous) or via a tube (into the stomach or small bowel). It is an emotive topic for many at the end of life. Many people fear that the dying person will starve or dehydrate, and this will hasten death and cause suffering. Viewpoints on this are influenced by ethnicity, culture, religion, and personal experience. Current practice in the UK is not to offer these treatments as standard, mainly as the evidence is insufficient, but to consider each patient individually.
An elderly female is admitted from a nursing home due to a fever and low oxygen saturations. She has a history of dementia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The nurse accompanying her from the nursing home describes how she has had a reduced appetite for a number of months, has been in bed more recently and has been more drowsy over the last week. After assessment by a junior doctor and consultant, it is felt that she is approaching the end of life. At the time of her dementia diagnosis, the patient put in place an Advance Decision which states that:
	If I have an incurable and irreversible Terminal Condition that will result in my death within a relatively short time, I direct that:
		i) I not be given Life Support or other life-prolonging treatment
		ii) I not receive Tube Feeding even if withholding such feeding would hasten my death
		iii) I not receive Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation in the event of cardiac arrest.
Her daughter, who has Power of Attorney for Welfare and Finance, asks that her mother be given intravenous fluids for hydration and is also considered for nasogastric feeding so that she does not starve to death.
### 1) Why might her daughter be requesting these treatments?

- **Emotional distress and fear of “starving/dehydrating to death”**: many people equate lack of intake with suffering or abandonment, even when reduced intake can be part of the dying process.
- **Hope for reversibility**: fever/low oxygen may feel like an acute, treatable episode; daughter may think fluids/feeding could “help her recover.”
- **Guilt and responsibility** (especially as POA): she may feel she must “do everything,” or fear being seen as letting her mother die.
- **Misunderstanding of what clinically assisted hydration/nutrition can achieve**: may assume it improves comfort/energy or meaningfully prolongs life.
- **Cultural/religious/personal values**: beliefs about feeding as basic care rather than medical treatment can strongly influence requests.

---

### 2) Should intravenous fluids be given?

**Start from the Advance Decision.** It refuses “life-prolonging treatment” in a terminal condition. IV fluids can be life-prolonging in some contexts, but can also be used as a **time-limited, symptom-focused** measure.

A practical ethically/legally defensible approach:

- **Check validity and applicability**: Is she in an “incurable and irreversible terminal condition likely to result in death in a relatively short time”? The team believes she is approaching end of life; if that’s the case, the ADRT is likely applicable.
- If applicable, IV fluids **should not be given routinely** as default life-prolonging treatment.
- However, you can consider a **time-limited trial** only if the aim is **comfort** and there’s a clear rationale (e.g., distressing thirst/dry mouth that is not responding to mouth care), with a defined review point and stop criteria.

So: **generally no as standard**, but consider **individualised comfort-focused use** if consistent with the ADRT’s intent and best interests.

---

### 3) Should a tube feeding be arranged?

If the Advance Decision is valid and applicable, this is the clearest part:

- The patient explicitly states: **“I not receive Tube Feeding even if withholding such feeding would hasten my death.”**

So if applicable, **no** - nasogastric feeding should not be started, even if the daughter requests it, because the patient has made a specific prior refusal.

---

### 4) Compare with the previous case: what’s the same and what’s different?

#### Same challenges

- **Applicability**: Does the current situation fit the exact circumstances described in the Advance Decision?
- **Family distress vs patient autonomy**: relatives may sincerely want what they believe is compassionate, but the ADRT is about the patient’s wishes.
- **Emotive nature of “treatment vs basic care”**: feeding/hydration triggers strong moral intuitions and fear of suffering.
- **Moral distress for clinicians**: balancing compassion for family with duty to respect the patient’s decision.

#### Different challenges

- **Clarity of refusal**: this case is more explicit about tube feeding than the previous overdose case (less ambiguity if ADRT applies).
- **Role of POA**: daughter has **Power of Attorney**, which can raise expectations that she “decides,” but POA does not override a valid, applicable ADRT.
- **Clinical context**: this is **natural end-of-life decline** with dementia/COPD, rather than an acute self-harm event; that often makes “terminal condition” criteria more plausibly met.
- **Nature of the requested interventions**: hydration/nutrition sit in a grey area for many people (seen as comfort/basic care), whereas ICU refusal/self-harm treatment debates are framed differently.
