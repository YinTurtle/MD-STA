### LO
- Consider the venous anatomy of the leg
- Discuss differences between arterial and venous thromboembolism.
- Identify clusters of signs and symptoms
- Identify risk factors associated with orthopaedic surgery
- Produce and present a poster highlighting an evidence-based aspect of the scenario
- Consider the strengths and areas for improvement of yourself and other team members through self and peer appraisal

[[Coagulation - normal and abnormal|reference]]

>You are on GP attachment in Cupar and go with your GP supervisor on a home visit to see Margaret Collins, a 63 year old female. You think of a few questions to ask the GP.

-  63 year old shows risk factor for VTE (venous thromboembolism)

>The GP tells you that Margaret has been home for 2 weeks, following an uneventful right total knee replacement for long standing osteoarthritis. On discharge from hospital, Margaret was given a 14 day supply of dalteparin injections; 5000 units daily subcutaneous; and a paper information leaflet for this medication along with written post-operative care advice.  Margaret had contacted the practice that morning complaining of a sore lower right leg.

- Orthopaedic surgery (especially knee/hip replacement) has a very high VTE risk.
	- Virchow's Triad
		- Venous stasis (slowed blood flow) - from reduced mobility and bed rest after surgery
		- Endothelial Injury (blood vessel damage) - from bone cutting etc
		- Hypercoagulability (increased clotting tendency) - surgery triggers an inflammatory response, which cause the body to release high levels of clotting factors and reducing the effectiveness of natural anticoagulants.
- "Dalteparin 5000 units daily" is the standard care - it is a prophylaxis.
	- Acts as an anticoagulant (blood thinner) to prevent VTE - normally at least 14 days up to 35 days
		- Blood thinner reduce clot risk by interfering with the body's coagulation process, preventing new clots from forming or existing ones from growing. Work by inhibiting clotting proteins or preventing platelets from clumping.

>Margaret has no other relevant medical history other than osteoarthritis. Her 67-year-old husband has been caring for her since she came out of hospital, they have no additional support at home. Margaret is a retired administrator. Since returning home she has been reluctant to weight bear and has spent much of her time sitting in her chair watching television.  When taking the history from Margaret, the GP asks her about her current medication and allergies. She has no allergies, but Margaret does tell the GP that she stopped taking the dalteparin injections after 3 days as it was causing small bruises on her abdomen. She did not realise the full significance of the medication as she struggled to understand the leaflet.

- - "Stopped taking dalteparin after 3 days due to brusing" - bruising is common and expected
	- Bruising is expected because the blood thinner stops blood from clotting quickly, so bumping into something or a small injury can cause blood to leak out of the vessel to cause a bruise
	- Margaret did not understand the importance
		- this is a health literacy and discharge counselling issue
- "Reluctant to weight bear, sitting in chair watching TV"
	- Can cause venous stasis
		- part of virchow's triad
			- Stasis
			- Endothelial injury (from surgery)
			- Hypercoagulability (post-op state)

>You elicit the following signs and symptoms from the patient:
>
>·         GCS 15, BMI 34 (from GP records prior to surgery), short of breath at rest sitting in chair.

- BMI 34 = obesity = prothrombotic state

>·         Pleuritic right sided chest pain

- Symptom for pulmonary embolism
	- can be caused by pulmonary infarction
	- pleural irritation

>·         Chest examination normal
·         Respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. SpO2 88% (FiO2 = 0.21)

- Hypoxia - suggests large or multiple emboli
- Normal chest xray + hypoxia = is a normal indication of pulmonary embolism
- Tachypnoea is an early PE sign

>·         Right calf tender, hot and swollen – circumference 4cm greater than left calf.

- Suggest proximal DVT
	- as 3 cm difference is significant between asymptomatic leg in Wells criteria - counts as +1 point

>The GP suspects a venous thromboembolism (VTE) and immediately arranges for Margaret to be taken to hospital. The GP writes a short referral letter whilst waiting for the ambulance.  Margaret is given oxygen in the ambulance and the paramedics insert a peripheral venous catheter (PVC).

- PE causes hypoxia

>Physical findings on admission to the Emergency Department (ED) include:
>
·         Vital signs as per the EWS chart
>
·         Productive cough with haemoptysis
>
Investigation results:
>
·         Chest x-ray is normal.   
>
·         12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) shows evidence of right ventricular strain.
>
·         An ultrasound scan (doppler) detects a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the right lower limb.

- Chest x-ray is normal is common in PE (due to blood clot are soft tissue, so not enough density to be visible on cxr). Normally used to exclude pneumonia, pneumothorax
	- but can be used to detect atelectasis (lung collapse or airless tissue)
	- pleural effusion (fluid in chest)
- "ECG shows right ventricular strain"
	- increase pulmonary artery pressure
	- significant clot burden
- "Doppler detects DVT"
	- confirms clot source
- 37.9 degree celsius, NEWS 4, tachypnoea, 105 bpm - regular rhythm, 155/95 blood pressure, SpO2 92% - FiO2 0.28, 22 respiratory rate

>A full blood count (FBC) showed the following results:
>![[Pasted image 20260226143211.png]]
- "Hb 111"
	- mild anaemia
- "Platelets 370"
	- normal, which means its safe to anti-coagulate
		- If high or low, it can increase risk of bleeding

>Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis on 28% oxygen shows PaO2 = 9.7kPa
>
>A Wells Score is calculated which suggests a pulmonary embolism (PE) is likely.

- "ABG on 28% O2 - PaO2 .7 kPa"
	- still hypoxic despite oxygen
		- suggests significant PE
		- impaired gas exchange
			- Pressure driving the oxygen into tissues is insufficient
- "Wells score suggests PE likely"
	- DVT signs, HR, recent surgery, haemoptysis (coughing blood from airway/lungs)

>Possible investigations that were considered and discussed included: coagulation status, ventilation/perfusion scan (V/Q scan), CTPA. 
>
>The management plan discussion included anticoagulation (low molecular weight heparin, apixaban and warfarin were mentioned) and “clot busting”. 

- Testing coagulation status (PT - prothrombin time, aPTT - activated partial tromboplastin time, INR (international normalized ratio)
	- blood tests measuring how long it takes for blood to clot
		- testing different clotting pathways to detect bleeding disorders, liver disease, or monitor anticoagulant
- Ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scan
	- compares air flow (ventilation) to blood flow (perfusion)
		- PE causes perfusion defect with normal ventilation - so there is a mismatch
	- It is preferred if the patient has an allergy to the contrast material, pregnancy, young patients (reduce radiation)
- CTPA (CT pulmonary angiogram) is preferred first-line in most patients
	- V/Q also becomes difficult to interpret if CXR abnormal (hers was normal so it *technically* could have been used)
	- CTPA shows direct filling defect in pulmonary artery, clot burden, RV strain
		- CTPA is best here because
			- Margaret has a High Wells score, hypoxia, ECG showing RV strain, confirmed DVT, and she is stable enough for CT
- D-dimer
	- A D-dimer test measures a protein fragment (fibrin degradation product) in the blood that is produced when a blood clot is broken down. It is primarily used to rule out active, dangerous blood clotting disorders like deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE). Normal levels are generally  < 500 ng/mL, though they can increase with age, pregnancy, or recent injury.

>Margaret is admitted to the Medical Assessment Unit, as it is thought that there is a high probability of PE.
>
Margaret makes an excellent recovery and is discharged home 2 days later with a supply of apixaban 10mg twice daily for 7 days then 5mg apixaban twice daily, a completed alert card and information booklet. Additional home help is arranged, and physiotherapy organised to support mobility. An immediate discharge letter (IDL) is generated by the FY1 on the Medical Assessment Unit in which there is information regarding the commencement of apixaban and they request that the GP continues to prescribe apixaban 5mg twice daily for a total period of 6 months.

- Anticoagulation - prevent further clot propagation and allow the body to lyse existing clot
	- anticoagulation does not dissolve the clot immediately
- Dalteparin (low molecular weight heparin)
	- adv
		- rapid onset
		- predictable effect
		- no monitoring needed
		- safe in cancer
			- not ideal long term because of daily injections, bruising concerns, she already stopped LMWH in the past
- Warfarin
	- not preferred because many drugs interactions, slow onset, requires INR (international normalized ratio) monitoring
		- used mainly for severe renal impairment, mechanical heart valves
	- Easily reversible - based on vitamin K
		- better for risk of falls (so some older patient may use this instead of Apixaban)
- Apixaban (DOAC)
	- preferred because it has a rapid onset, no INR monitoring, lower major bleeding risk vs warfarin, good evidence base for VTE

### Overall Clinical Reasoning Summary
|Decision|Why Chosen|Why Not Others|
|---|---|---|
|CTPA|Gold standard, stable patient|V/Q not needed|
|Apixaban|Oral, effective, no monitoring|Warfarin outdated, LMWH injections|
|No thrombolysis|Not hypotensive|Bleeding risk too high|
|6 months duration|Provoked PE|No need lifelong|
|Admission|Hypoxic + RV strain|Not low-risk|
