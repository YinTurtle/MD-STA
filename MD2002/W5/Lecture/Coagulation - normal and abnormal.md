### LO
- Define the term haemostasis
- Describe the production and function of platelets
- Outline the main elements of the coagulation cascade
- Be aware of the commonly used coagulation tests
- Be aware of examples of congenital and acquired coagulation disorders
- Describe factors which increase risk of clotting and clinical examples
- To explain the mechanism by which blood clots are dissolved

**Haemostasis** - a physiological process that stops bleeding while maintaining normal blood flow elsewhere

**Platelets** - derived from megakaryocytes in marrow.

### Endothelial cells
steady-state is to prevent clots forming
- line blood vessels and form a barrier
- produce thrombomodulin and heparin sulphate to inhibit thrombin production
- prostacyclin and nitric oxide to reduce platelet adhesion

### Platelets
- fragments of megakaryocyte cytoplasm
- budded off into lumen of marrow sinusoids (discontinued capillaries)
- circulate for 5-10 days
- form a 'plug' when attracted by lowered prostacyclin and by collagen exposure
- thromboxane A2 and serotonin from platelets cause vasoconstriction
- There is a storage of platelets within the spleen

Platelets know where to clot because blood vessel damage exposes underlying collagen and release von Willebrand factor (vWF), which acts as a "sticky" signals that trap passing platelets. Upon contact, platelets change shape, release ADP and serotonin to recruit more platelets, forming a plug.
- adhere to each other via glycoprotein 11b-11a and fibrinogen

### Coagulation Cascade
Factors present in un-activated state-activated by
- Intrinsic pathway (endothelial collagen)
- Extrinsic pathway (trans-membrane protein in connective tissue and monocytes - "tissue factor")



Fibrin is the final substance that makes the clot
What tube type is used for all coagulation tests: *sodium citrate*

#### Coagulation Inhibitors
- Protein C activated by thrombomodulin (on endothelial surface) binding with thrombin to inactivate it
- With co-factor- Factor S- Va and VIIIa are degraded by activated factor C
- Antithrombin (previously antithrombin III) degrades Xa and IIa

### Fibrinolytic system

> Needs to be done in <4.5 hours from first symptoms, some risk of bleedings afterwards

### Measurement of coagulation
- Full blood count - includes platelets count/size/granules but is a poor assessment of platelets function - specialised test of aggregation can be done
	- reference range of 150-400 x 10$^9$/L
	- Easy brusing and purpura (pinpoints of bleeding flat with the skin) when <30-50
		- (thrombocytopenia) - deficiency of platelets in the blood
	- Risk of major bleeding if <10

### Prothrombin time (PT)
- All coagulation tests are done on citrated plasma - removes calcium (ratio of blood to citrate is important so don't over-or under fill)
- At 37$^o$C thromboplastin and calcium added
- prolonged by low levels of II, X, VII
- warfarin reduces functioning II, VII, IX, X so a useful measure of dose-expressed as INR

### Vitamin K dependent coagulation factors
Vitamin K is essential for blood clotting, acting as a cofactor for the enzyme-glutamyl carboxylase in the liver to activate clotting factors II (prothrombin), VII, IX, and X, as well as proteins C and S. It enables these proteins to bind calcium and adhere to platelet surfaces, initiating the coagulation cascade.

### APTT (activated partial thromboplastin test)
- calcium, kaolin and phospholipids added to citrated plasma
- measure of intrinsic and common pathway
- prolonged in haemophilia and by heparin

### Fibrinogen "factor 1"
- final substrate for making fibrin
- can be measured by clot density or by thrombin time - thrombin and calcium added to citrated plasma

### Inherited blood disorders
- haemophilia A and B - genetic X linked defect in VIII or IX gene
	- X-linked recessive condition - females are usually carriers
- Commonly a new mutation, so no family history
- around 1:5000 of males
- female heterozygotes (carriers) not affected
### Haemophilia - treatment
- No treatment - then fresh frozen plasma
- Prophylaxis or treatment of bleeding episodes
	- to replace missing clotting factors, and preventing spontaneous joint/muscle bleeds, avoiding long-term joint damage
- Issues of Hep B or C and HIV (when getting blood/plasma)
### Von Willebrand disease
- usually autosomal dominant
- defect in platelet adhesion and binding of Factor VIII
- mild disease - easy bruising - similar to haemophilia
### Acquired coagulation disease
#### Liver failure
- Liver disease - alcohol/autoimmune/viral hep
- All coagulation factors produced in liver
- PT and fibrinogen abnormal, later APPT abnormal
- Bleeding due to low coagulation factors and low platelets
#### Disseminated intra-vascular coagulation (DIC)
- Pathological excessive activation of clotting cascade due to
	- trauma
	- malignancy (e.g. prostate cancer)
	- sepsis
	- amniotic fluid embolism
- Causes depletion of clotting factors and damage due to clot plugging vessels
- Treat the cause and replace clotting factors
### Low platelets (thrombocytopenia)
- could be due to:
	- under production
	- increased use
	- abnormal distribution
	![[Pasted image 20260226155001.png]]
#### Under production
- Abnormal marrow function - acute leukaemia, metastatic tumour
- Expected side effect of cytotoxic chemotherapy
- Idiosyncratic and unexpected drug adverse effect e.g. co-trimoxazole, anti-inflammatories
#### Increased use
- Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP)
	- autoimmune disease of children or adults
	- can be triggered by infection or drug
	- auto antibodies to platelets
- Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia
#### Abnormal distribution
- Splenomegaly e.g. portal hypertension, leukaemia
- Large haemangioma
### Increased risk of clotting - thrombophilia
- Inherited defects in coag inhibitors e.g. protein C, S, antithrombin
- Inherited defect in Factor V - V Leiden
- Acquired problems "virchow's triad" of abnormal
	- vessel wall
	- flow
	- blood component
#### Abnormal vessel wall
- atheroma and plaque
- varicose veins
- aneurysm
#### Abnormal flow
- atrial fibrillation
- immobile (e.g. surgery, long flight etc)
- varicose veins
#### Abnormal blood component
- increased haemoglobin/red cell count - polycythaemia
- increased wbc or platelet count - stasis and increased clotting
- increased viscosity of plasma
- reduced coag factor inhibitors
