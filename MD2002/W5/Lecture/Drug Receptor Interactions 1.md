### LO
- To explain the concepts of drug-receptor theory
- To apply the law of mass action to drug receptor interactions
- To define the terms agonists and antagonists
- To recognise concentration- and log concentration-response curves
- To describe what is meant by a drug's affinity for receptors

### Receptor Theory
**Agonist** binds to a receptor to produce a response.
- Fully reversible
**Antagonist** binds to a receptor to *not* produce a response
- Also fully reversible
- Don't have any intrinsic efficacy

4 regulatory protein families are commonly drug targets and are covered by the term receptor:
- enzymes
- carrier molecules (transporters)
- ion channels
- neurotransmitter, hormone, or local hormone receptors

### Law of Mass Action
The rate of a chemical reaction is proportional to product of the concentration of the reactants.

#### Applying to Pharmacology
![[Pasted image 20260223111624.png]]
(D) is the conc of drug
(R) is the conc of receptors
(DR) is the conc of occupied receptors
(K1) is the rate of constant for associations
(K2) is the rate constant for dissociations

As you add drugs, there will be a rate of associations (K1.(D).(R))
but there will also be rate of dissociations (K2.(DR))

Bounded/unbounded drug = how some drugs are still available.
Specificity/unspecificity = affinity and target selection

The labelled drug can displace the unlabelled drug (the specialised drug, as the drug can simply bind to any of the receptor without needing specificity)

### Equilibrium dissociation constant
Equilibrium when rate of associations = rate of dissociations.

**High affinity** = you only need a low conc of drug to occupy 50% of receptors
**Low affinity** = need high conc of drug to occupy 50% of receptors

The equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) represents the concentration of drug required to occupy 50% of the receptors at equilibrium (this only measures the specific binding)
KD is different for every drug
- measure of affinity of any one drug for one receptor (meaning that a drug will have different affinity to different receptors they bind to)

#### Affinity
KD
How easy it is for the drug to bind with the receptor and dissociate. And how easy it is to unbind and dissociate the receptor from the drug.

It is conventional to express the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) as -log10 of the KD. This is called **pD2** for an agonist:
![[Pasted image 20260223113139.png]]
pD2 is the -log10 of (D) that occupies 50% of the receptors at equilibrium.

e.g.
**High affinity** = Once the drug binds to the receptor, it is *harder* for the drug to separate from the receptor
**Low affinity** = Once the drug binds to the receptor, it is *easy* for the drug to separate from the receptor.

### Efficacy
The maximum response of a tissue can be obtained by occupying less than 100% of the receptors.
- Different drugs have different capacities to initiate a response
- Dependant on the receptor that is binding to
Once the drug and receptor bind and associated, how easy is it to cause a response.

Very efficacious drugs will require to occupy fewer receptors to give a response than less efficacious ones.

#### Occupancy Theory
Response = (DR)/(RT)
(DR) = number of occupied receptors
(RT) = total number of receptors

If <100% of receptors are required to evoke a maximum response, then these "extra" receptors are referred to as **spare receptors**
