### LO
- To list the drugs used to modify blood coagulation
- To explain the mechanisms of action of these drugs
- To relate the mechanism of action for these drugs to the therapeutic outcome
- To identify the major side effects of these drugs

### Main constituents of coagulation
- Vessel wall lined by [[Coagulation - normal and abnormal|endothelium]]
- Platelets-derived from megakaryocytes in marrow
- Coagulation factors in inactive state
- Inhibitors of coagulation
- Fibrinolytic system and inhibitors

### Drugs to help blood clot/prevent bleeding
Platelets - derived from blood donation
- Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) - 200ml plasma from blood donation - contain coag factors in physiological conc. Dose approx 15 ml/kg
- Cryoprecipitate - FFP briefly exposed to -60C produces milky precipitate of concentrated fibrinogen, Von Willebrand factor and VIII
- Specific coag factors e.g. IX, VIII (donor-dervied or recombinant) and fibrinogen
### Tranexamic
- Anti-fibrinolytic drug
	- dissolve clot away
- Can be administered via oral or intravenously (IV)
- inhibits activation of plasminogen to plasmin
- uses in trauma/GI bleeding/post op or delivery
	- can slow down the clot from dissolving/flowing away too quickly

### Vitamin K
- produces Factors II, VII, IX, X
- Warfarin inhibits production of vitamin K in reduced form
### Warfarin
- effect measured by prothrombin time
- Positive
	- established
	- cheap
	- easily measurable effect
	- can be reversed with vitamin K or factor concentrate
- Negative
	- lost of drug and food interactions to enhance or inhibit effect
	- slow onset-several days
	- unpredictable dose required (e.g. 1-15mg)
	- needs regular blood testing
	- risk of bleeding
	- Narrow "therapeutic window"
- Increase effect of warfarin
	- *amoxycillin* - reduce gut vitamin K
	- erythromycin, statins, acute alcohol intake - enzyme inhibition
	- aspirin, clopidogrel, increase bleeding risk
- Decrease effect of warfarin
	- *rifampicin*, chronic alcohol intake - enzyme induction

### Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs)
- Activated factor Xa inhibitors e.g. apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban
- direct thrombin inhibitors e.g. dabigatran

### Warfarin vs DOACs
Warfarin
- cheap but needs monitoring
- can be reversed
- effect can be easily measured
- can be used with poor renal function
- also effective for stroke prevention
DOACs
- no monitoring needed
- lower bleeding risk
- effective for stroke prevention
- short half life
- expensive for reversal agent

### Oral anticoagulation - indications
- Treatment of DVT and PE - short or long term depending on whether is it recurrent or provoked
- Atrial fibrillation to reduce stroke risk
- prosthetic heart valve replacement - warfarin only
- prevention of DVT after planned hip and knee surgery - DOACs only

### Stoke risk reduction in atrial fibrillation
- Be aware of
	- absolute and relative risk reduction
	- balance of risks and benefits
	- risk score for
		- thrombosis
		- bleeding

### Heparin
Naturally occurring anticoagulant
- Given as
	- IV infusion - half life <1 hour, so immediate effect and wears off quickly
	- Subcutaneous (s/c) - low molecular weight - half life approx 12 hours
- Binds to and activates anti-thrombin so reducing Xa and thrombin generation

#### Adverse effects
- Pain at site of injection
- Increased bleeding risk
- Osteoporosis with prolonged use
- Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia - antibody mediated, 5-10 days into treatment
#### Drugs to modify platelet function-aspirin
- Aspirin are used to prevent heart attack, some strokes etc (but much more effectively prevented by warfarin/DOAC)
- Increase in GI bleeding risk, dyspepsia
##### Clopidogrel and ticagrelor
- Inhibit ADP induced platelet aggregation
- Used with or without aspirin for secondary prevention of atherosclerotic arterial events
- Used in ischaemic stroke and TIAs
- Increased risk of dyspepsia and GI bleeding
- No reversal agents for anti-platelet drugs, so effect will last the duration of platelet lifespan (5-10 days)
### Thrombolytic drugs
- Drugs to increase activation of plasminogen to plasmin
- Tissue plasminogen activators (tPA) e.g. streptokinase - used for thrombolysis brain/heart/occluded venous catheters
- Cause breakdown of fibrin and fibrinogen
- Increased bleeding risk in hours after dose
- Stenting and clot removal
