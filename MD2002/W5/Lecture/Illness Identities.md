#### Illness identity
Illness identity can be defined as the degree to which a chronic health condition, such as heart disease, is integrated into someone's identity.
### Theoretical concepts
###### Sociological theory
can explain how individuals construct their illness identities
###### Symbolic Interactionism
explores how people create an interpret meanings through social interactions
- it is the most drawn upon theory used to explain how individuals construct their illness identities based on their interactions with society

#### Parsons' Sick Role Theory
**Sick Role** - which describes societal expectations for those experiencing illness
- exemption from normal duties
- not blamed from illness
- obligation to seek medical help and recover
- assume a passive patient role
- structured societal responses to illness, recognises medical authority in defining illness
##### Biological disruption
Being diagnosed with a chronic illness forces individuals to renegotiate their identity, relationships, and future expectations

##### Stigma and Labelling Theory
- Stigma can lead to social exclusion or identity
- Cultural stigma can lead to individuals to manage or conceal their condition
- Social stigma associated with certain illnesses can discourage individuals from seeking healthcare

### How do personal, social, and cultural factors shape illness experiences?
- Personal Factors
	- coping mechanisms
	- past experiences
	- socioeconomic status
	- health literacy
- Social Factors
	- support network
	- stigma & social labelling
	- work and employment
- Cultural Factors
	- cultural beliefs and explanations
	- medical pluralism (alternative medicine)
	- language and communication

#### Illness identity in context
###### Navigating Illness
patients may manage how they present their condition in various settings - deciding whether to disclose an illness, how to respond to social reactions, and how to integrate their diagnosis into their sense of self.
>e.g. a patient with anxiety may choose to keep their diagnosis private in some situations but disclose it when seeking employment related accommodations
###### Performing Illness
society has expectations about how "sick people" should behave. People may feel pressured to act in ways that validate their illness, whether by appearing visibly unwell or conforming to medical and social norms of the "sick role.
>e.g. someone with chronic pain may feel the need to "prove" their suffering because their condition is invisible
###### Negotiating Illness
patients may negotiate their illness identity in interactions with family, peers, healthcare professionals, and even strangers. This can involve challenging stereotypes, advocating for themselves, or adapting to societal expectations.
>e.g. a person diagnosed with diabetes may resist being labelled as “unhealthy” and instead position themselves as someone actively managing their condition.

People with an 'illness identity' may hinder or stop people from getting their treatment in order to not look different from others.

### Doctor's role
- Illness identity affects the doctor-patient relationship
- Doctor's role in shaping identity
	- How diagnosis can change self-perception
	- How language matters 'you have diabetes' vs 'you're diabetic'
