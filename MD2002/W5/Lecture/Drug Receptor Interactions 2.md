### LO
- To explain the concept of efficacy
- To apply the concept of efficacy to drug-receptor interactions
- To identify the 2 properties of drugs interaction with recpetors
- To recognise the difference between competitive and non-competitive antagonists
- To illustrate the effects of partial agonists, inverse agonists and antagonists upon concentration-reponse curves
- To relate the concept of efficacy to signal-transduction mechanisms

[[Drug Receptor Interactions 1#Affinity]] (KD or KA) is a measure of the conc range over which a drug binds to its receptor - how likely it is to bond.
[[Drug Receptor Interactions 1#Efficacy]] is the ability of the drug to generate a stimulus once bound to its receptor - how efficient it is to generate a stimulus.

### Partial Agonists
Partial agonists can lower the response to a full agonist because some receptors will be occupied by partial agonist molecules, giving a smaller response than if all the receptors were occupied by full agonist molecules.

### Competitive Antagonism
A competitive antagonist may be regarded as a drug which interacts/binds reversibly with receptors to form a complex but this complex does not generate a stimulus (no efficacy).

To displace the antagonist on the receptor, need to increase the conc of agonist. This causes a shift of the graph to the right.

This works vice versa. so is it true that to displace an agonist, need to increase conc of antagonist. 

#### Schild Equation

Antagonist can bind to the receptor, have an affinity. The affinity of Ka is the conc of antagonist that makes it necessary to add twice as much agonist to produce a response as would be needed in the absence of the antagonist.

### Irreversible Competitive Antagonism
Binds, but dissociates very slowly (else permanent)
![[Pasted image 20260226102451.png]]

Slope of Log Dose-response curves decreased by an irreversible competitive antagonist.
Maximum response to agonist decreased.

### Allosteric Modulators
Bind to sites on the receptor other than the agonist binding site and can modify agonist activity.
![[Pasted image 20260226102632.png]]

Allosteric sites are regulatory, not 'active' binding sites.
Can modify the [[Drug Receptor Interactions 1#Affinity]] or [[Drug Receptor Interactions 1#Efficacy]] of a receptor's endogenous ligand or drug.
Does it happen after the agonist binds to the receptor, and if so does it change the agonist shape permanently if it leaves. #ask
- Potentiate or inhibit

### Non Competitive antagonist
Non competitive antagonists are an example of allosteric modulation - the antagonist blocks access of the agonist to its binding sites through steric hindrance.

#### Negative affinity modulation

#### Negative efficacy modulation

### Inverse Agonists
![[Pasted image 20260226103049.png]]
Inverse agonists are drugs that bind to receptors and reduce their [[Drug Receptor Interactions 1#Efficacy]]. Whereas antagonist only block the receptor. Follow the same log-dose response.

### Questions
- Lower value of Kd (nm), has the greater affinity.
- Higher value of pD2, has the greater affinity.
- If both drugs have the same pD2, and the same conc; regardless of effect, when asking for greatest affinity, its still the same value for both since the question is not asking for efficacy.
- Concerning drug receptor interactions, the Kd refers to drug conc required to occupy 50% of receptors
- Competitive inhibition is based on reversible drug/antagonist binding at receptor sites
- None competitive antagonist cannot be overcome by increase conc of agonist
