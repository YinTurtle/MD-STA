### LO
- To understand the effects of drugs upon the synthesis and storage of noradrenaline.
- To know the uses and clinical conditions for which these drugs are used.
- To investigate the actions and uses of drugs which affect the release and inactivation of noradrenaline.
- To know the effects of noradrenergic agonists and antagonists on tissues.
- To understand the uses of these agonists and antagonists in clinical conditions.
- To know named examples of agonists and antagonists and whether they are selective or nonselective in their actions on adrenoreceptors.

### Catecholamines
Tyrosine hydroxylase
- Rate limiting step
- Inhibited by catecholamines
DOPA decarboxylase
- Methyldopa
	- Hypertension in pregnancy
Dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH)
- Membrane bound
PNMT
- Mainly located in the adrenal medulla
- Induced by adrenal cortex bound

### Noradrenaline (NA) release
#addinfo

### Noradrenaline uptake and degradation
#addinfo 

### Drugs that affect noradrenergic neurons
#### Drugs that affect catecholamine synthesis
- e.g. methyldopa
#### Drugs that affect catecholamine release
- Indirectly acting sympathomimetics - e.g. amphetamines
- By acting on alpha2 adrenoreceptors - e.g. clonidine
#### Inhibitors of catecholamine uptake
- NET inhibitors - e.g. cocaine, tricylic antidepressants
#### Inhibitors of catecholamine metabolic degradation
- Monoamine oxidase inhibitors used in depression

### Sympathetic nervous system

### ANS adrenergic receptors
Adrenergic receptors are metabotropic (G-protein coupled receptors)
2 main groups of adrenoreceptors:
![[Pasted image 20260223122336.png]]
There are exploitable differences in the selectivity of these receptors for catecholamines.
There are general patterns of tissue distribution that allows for some specificity of drug action.

### Pathologies
#### Upper respiratory tract infection
Nasal congestion
- Phenylephrine
	- Constriction of airway blood vessels (α1)
#### Asthma
- Coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath
	- Answer: agonist of beta 2
	- Salbutamol or Salmeterol (β2)
		- Salbutamol = short term
		- Salmeterol = long term
#### Premature labour
- Need to delay delivery to prepare treatment or transfer
	- Salbutamol
		- Also terbutaline
		- Relaxation of uterine smooth muscle (β2)
### Control of BP by sympathetic nervous system
![[Pasted image 20260223124006.png]]

**Sympathetic** stimulation *increases* cardiac output
- By increasing heart rate
- By increasing volume pumped on each stroke
- Both mediated by *β1* receptors
**Sympathetic** stimulation *increases* total peripheral resistance
- By constricting blood vessels (mainly small arteries/arterioles)
- Mediated by *α1* receptors

#### Cardiogenic shock
Damaged heart, unable to supply enough blood to the organs of the body.
- α1 agonist and β1 agonist 

#### Hypertension
Elevated blood pressure
- Antagonist for α1, antagonist for β1
Prazosin
- vasodilation by blocking alpha1 receptors
Propranolol
- decrease hr and force by blocking beta1
- renin release by kidneys 
Clonidine
- stimulation of pre-synaptic alpha2 receptors to decrease noradrenaline release.

#### Beta-blockers
Often referred to as cardioselective or non-cardioselective.
- Use of non-cardioselective potentially problematic in asthmatics
#### Cardiac arrest
Cessation of normal cardiac function.
- Adrenaline
	- vasoconstriction (alpha1)
	- increase heart rate and force (beta1)
#### Anaphylaxis
Narrowing of airways, drop in bp, skin rash, swelling
- Adrenaline
	- vasoconstriction (alpha1)
	- increase hr and force (beta1)
	- bronchodilation (beta2)
	- decrease histamine release by mast cells (beta2)
#### Benign prostatic hyperplasia
Swollen prostate causing problems with passing urine
Prazosin
- relax bladder neck and prostate capsule by blocking alpha1 receptors
Tamsulosin
- more prostate-specific
