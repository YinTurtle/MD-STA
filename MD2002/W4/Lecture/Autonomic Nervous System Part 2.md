### LO
- To recognise the two second messenger effects triggered by the postsynaptic effects of ACh upon the different types of muscarinic receptor.
- To know that the structure of cholinergic agonists influences their effects and know this relationship determines the clinical uses of cholinergic drugs.
- To recognise that muscarinic agonists show little or no selectivity between the subtypes of muscarinic receptor.
- To understand that selectivity of action with muscarinic agonists is achieved by a combination of choice of route of administration and the ionised state of the drug.
- To know specific examples of cholinergic agonist and antagonists and the conditions for which they are used.

### Acetylcholine Receptors in ANS

In heart muscle, parasympathetic would over power the sympathetic state.

Tissues innervated by both branches of the ANS generally have a predominate tone.

#### Drugs acting on ACh with implications for ANS
![[Pasted image 20260219132002.png]]
##### Botox
**Botox** (botulinum toxin) works by inhibiting the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) from the presynaptic nerve terminals at the neuromuscular junction.
- By blocking this release, Botox prevents muscle contraction, causing temporary localized paralysis or muscle relaxation.
- It works by cleaving SNARE proteins in the nerve ending, preventing the fusion of ACh vesicles with the nerve terminal membrane.

### Effects of anticholinesterases
ANS
- Salivation
- Lacrimation
- Urination
- Defecation
- Gastrointestinal upset
- Emesis
---
- Bradycardia
- Hypotension
- Bronchoconstriction
- Pupillary constriction (miosis)

### Predominate locations of ACh receptors

Drugs that affect ACh at the NMJ may affect the ANS.

### Muscarinic vs nicotinic
Muscarinic and nicotinic ACh receptors share some agonist, but can be differentiated by others.
- Drugs that affect the synthesis, storage, release and termination of ACh will affect both receptor types
- Drugs that affect ACh at the Sk. NMJ may affect the AN

### Muscarinic ACh receptors
Classified by their tissue distribution and their cellular response.
![[Pasted image 20260219133130.png]]
Not all muscarinic receptors are in the ANS
- M1, M2, M4, and M5 also found in CNS
- M3 found on vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells

#### Muscarinic ACh receptor agonists
![[Pasted image 20260219134929.png]]
- Both is very highly charged.

#### Muscarinic ACh receptor antagonists

### Pharmacology
Very few diseases of ↓parasympathetic activity, more due to ↑ activity
- Little therapeutic use for agonists
General problem of selectivity with antagonists
- Few differentiate between subtypes effectively
- Muscarinic ACh receptors widespread, therefore, there are side effects
- Control by route of administration and distribution
