- Explain how muscle spindles monitor muscle length, while Golgi tendon organs monitor tension.
- Discuss how the myotatic, inverse myotatic and cross extensor withdrawal reflex may combine to produce simple repetitive movements
- Recall that the autonomic nervous system is involved in many reflexes

### What is  Reflex?
- Specific, involuntary, unpremeditated, "built-in" response to a particular stimulus
	- Protects
- Can be classified to:
	- Somatic reflexes - somatic motor neurones and skeletal muscles
		- Control muscle contraction
			- e.g. removing hand form hot object
				sensory receptor detects heat, sends signals to neurons, then motor neurones synapses the muscle to contract (spinal reflex)
			- e.g. lift foot off sharp object (spinal reflex)
			- e.g. shutting eyes as object rapidly approaches face (cranial reflex)
	- Autonomic (visceral) reflexes - baroreceptor reflex
		- e.g. regulate visceral (internal) function, heart rate, blood pressure, digestion, pupil dilation etc
- Acquired (learned) reflex
	- basically almost like muscle memory
	- Pavlov's dog salivating on hearing a bell

### Homeostasis
![[Pasted image 20260216121319.png]]
- Stimulus-response sequence
- Reflexes may be a component of homeostatic control systems
- Sometimes aware of stimulus and/or response (such as able to look at self shivering, or skin hair standing up)
- For many reflexes, no conscious awareness of doing such reflex

Examples of such homeostasis happening can occur not only for temperature, but also blood pressure etc.

### Pathway Mediating a Reflex Arc

### Classes of Movement
#### Voluntary
- Complex actions (reading, writing)
- Purposeful goal directed
- Learned
#### Reflexes
- Involuntary, rapid, stereotyped (knee jerk, eye blink)
#### Rhythmic motor patterns
- Combines voluntary and reflexive acts (chewing, walking, running)
- Initiation and termination voluntary
- Once initiated repetitive and reflexive

### Classification of Somatosensory Nerve Fibres
![[Pasted image 20260216122143.png]]
Myelinated fibres conduct nerve impulses significantly faster than unmyelinated fibres because myelin sheath acts as an electrical insulator, forcing the signal to jump between gaps in the sheath rather than traveling continuously along the entire membrane.

### Organisation of the Spinal Cord
- From the afferent sensory, it goes to the Lamina I-VI (dorsal horn)
- Then VII (lateral horn)
- Then VIII and IX (ventral horn)
![[Pasted image 20260216122531.png]]
**Order to spinal cord** 
1. Lamina I-VI (dorsal horn)
	1. terminations for primary afferent sensory neurons & neurons of reflex circuits
	2. Sensory input from joints and muscle (lamina VI)
2. Lamina VII (lateral horn)
	1. Preganglionic sympathetic (T1-L2) & parasympathetic (sacral)
3. Lamina VIII & IX (ventral horn)
	1. Cell bodies of motor neurons

- Motor neurons supplying muscles of trunk situated medially while those supplying distal muscles situated laterally
- Muscles that flex limbs lie dorsal to those that extend limbs

### Organisation of the Spinal Cord
- Alpha-motor neuron cell bodies lie in clumps within ventral horn of spinal cord (lower motor neurons)
- Each motor neuron activates a motor unit (6-1500 skeletal muscle fibres)
- Some axons branch back into cord and synapse with interneurons called **Renshaw cells** (recurrent or feedback inhibition)
	- Renshaw cells help provide smooth movements
	- Supresses weakly firing motor neurons and dampening strongly firing ones
	- Produces economical movement
- **Strychnine poisoning**
	- Disables Renshaw cell inhibition - leads to convulsions
	- This leads to very "jerky" contractions

### Myotatic (Knee Jerk) Reflex
- Good to test whether is it a upper or lower motor neurone issue
	- If exaggerated (hyperreflexia) - loss of inhibitory control from upper motor neurons (brain or spinal cord)
	- If reflex is weak or absent - loss or damage of lower motor neuron (nerve roots or peripheral nerves)
- Example of **monosynaptic** stretch reflex
![[Pasted image 20260216123835.png]]
- Reflex stimulates in the spinal cord - the motor neurons to the extensor muscle
	- While at the same time inhibits the antagonistic flexor muscle
- Tap of patellar tendon stretches quadriceps muscle
- Stimulates dynamic nuclear bag receptors of muscle spindle
- Increase in rate of firing of group Ia afferents leads to contraction of quadriceps muscle
- Ia fibres also stimulate inhibitory interneurons which inhibit antagonistic (flexor) muscle of knee joint
- Reflex is lost if lower lumbar dorsal roots of spinal cord are damaged

#### Muscle Spindles
- Are sensory receptors within skeletal muscles that detect changes in muscle length and velocity
- Serve as proprioceptors for central nervous system
	- Trigger stretch reflex - rapid, involuntary contraction of muscle to resist overstretching
- Lie parallel with skeletal muscle fibres
- Innervated by gamma-motoneurons (efferents) and group 1a and 11 afferent fibres
##### Voluntary Activity
- Muscle spindles play important role as comparators for maintenance of muscle length during goal directed voluntary movements
- Voluntary changes in muscle length initiated by motor areas of brain, orders include changes to set-point of muscle spindle
- Simultaneous activation of extrafusal fibres (alpha-motor neurons) and intrafusal fibres (gamma-motor neurons) is called alpha-gamma co-activation
- This process readjusts sensitivity of muscle spindle continuously as muscle shortens

### Inverse Myotatic (Golgi Tendon) Reflex
- Protective to prevent tearing of muscle (detachment of tendon)
- Contributes to maintenance of posture
- Stimulation of GTO receptor, sends signal to sensory, and sends to inhibitory interneuron
	- Inhibitory interneuron will stops the muscle from damaging itself
- GTO stimulated by increasing tension in muscle
- Signals transmitted to spinal cord - reflex entirely inhibitory
- Negative feedback mechanism which prevents development of excessive tension in muscle
- Inhibitory effect from GTO can be so great that it leads to sudden unloading of muscles
![[Pasted image 20260216124742.png]]
- Allows the proper up right posture
- Basically the reflex inhibits the agonist muscle and excites the antagonist

#### Golgi Tendon Organ (GTO)
- Main proprioceptors that provide information about the state of musculature
- Golgi tendon organs lie within tendons in series with contractile fibres
- Respond to degree of tension within the muscle
- Group Ib afferent fibres relay information to CNS (particularly spinal cord and cerebellum)

### Withdrawal Reflex and Crossed Extensor
- Protective reflex of rapidly removing limb from damaging stimuli
- Stimulation of withdrawal reflex, frequently elicits extension of the contralateral limb 250ms later
- Helps maintain posture and balance
![[Pasted image 20260216125131.png]]

### Locomotion
#### Step Cycle
- Stance phase
	- Foot touching ground, flexion of knee and ankle
	- Finishes with extension about all joints for forward movement
- Swing phase
	- Bending (flexion) of hip, knee and ankle followed by knee and ankle straightening (extension)
- Alternate swing and stance that are out of phase
![[Pasted image 20260216125345.png]]
- All of these generated within the spinal cord

#### Central Pattern Generator (CPG)
- located in spinal cord - capable of autonomous signals
- modulated by proprioception input
- thought to be initiated by mesencephalic locomotor region
##### For Walking
- 2 half centres which activate flexors and extensors respectively and which mutually inhibit each other
- Can be modelled using inhibitory 1a interneurons and Renshaw cells (RC)
