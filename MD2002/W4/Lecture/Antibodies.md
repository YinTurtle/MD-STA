### LO
- To describe the various classes of human antibodies and their functional diversity.
- To understand how antibody diversity is generated.
- To describe the generation and uses of monoclonal antibodies.
- To understand antibody function and antibody/antigen immune complexes.

Antibodies are produced by B lymphocytes.

Lymphocytes arise from stem cells in bone marrow, and differentiate in the central lymphoid organs (red), B cells in bone marrow, T cells in thymus. They migrate in bloodstream to peripheral secondary lymphoid organs (yellow), lymph nodes, spleen, gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), Peyers patches, tonsils, appendix.

- Naive B cells, ie that have not met antigen, circulate from blood into peripheral lymphoid tissues.
- Peripheral lymphoid tissues are the main site of antigen encounter
- Lymphatics drain tissues of fluid, through the lymph nodes and into the thoracic duct. Recirculating B cells enter back into the bloodstream by the thoracic duct.

Lymph nodes swell because B cells are proliferating during an immune response, which produces antibodies.

### Lymph node organisation
- Organised into cortex and inner medula.
- Cortex has an outer section of B cells organised into follicles (yellow), and a paracortical area of T cells and dendritic cells (blue).
- Germinal Centres of B cell proliferation form during an immune response.
- Medulla consists of macrophages and antibody secreting B cells (Plasma cells).
- Antigen (in DC) enter through afferent lymphatics.

### Spleen
- Red pulp is site of RBC destruction. White pulp is lymphoid.
- Blood carrying lymphocytes and antigen enter from a trabecular artery into a central arteriole. 
- They can then pass into a marginal sinus and exit through a trabecular vein.
- The marginal sinus is surrounded by lymphocytes, and within it is the periarteriolar sheath (PALS), made up of T cells.
- B cell follicles and a B cell corona also form. 

- **Important** - antigen enters from blood rather than lymph

### Course of antibody production
![[Pasted image 20260219151901.png]]
- Memory B cells are being stored for future response
- B cells form part of the adaptive immune response, the key features of which are antigen specificity, and memory.
- Three key points:
	- the secondary (memory) response is faster, 
	- can produce more antibody
	- does not prevent you from making a response to another antigen (multiple antigens -vaccination)

### Basic features of antibodies (Ab)
- Antibodies can be expressed as membrane bound (B cell receptor - BCR) or secreted forms.
- B cells express a single Ab specificity only.
- Ab have two separate functions, firstly to bind the pathogen that elicited its production, and secondly to recruit other cells and molecules that will lead to clearance or destruction of the pathogen.
- Ab are made of four polypeptide chains, two identical heavy (H) chains and two identical light chains (L). The H chains are disulfide bonded to each other, and each H chain is also disulfide bonded to a L chain.
- Two L chain exist, lambda (!) and kappa ("). Any individual Ab has either ! or ", never a mixture of each. In human the ratio is 2:1 in favour of ".

### Antibody structure
2 identical H and L chains results in two identical binding sites.

### Extra variability by Junctional Diversity
- N-nucleotides, (non template-encoded) are added by terminal deoxynulceotidyl transferase (TdT)
- After up to 20 nucleotides are added, pairing is attempted, followed by trimming off nonmatching bases, filling gaps and ligation to complete (all is random).

### Somatic Hypermutation
During the course of an immune response mutations accumulate in the V regions of the H and L chain genes. Some of these will bind antigen better and these cells are selected to expand and secrete antibody. This is called *affinity maturation*.

### Antibody  multimers
- IgM can be secreted as pentamers, IgA as dimers. Both involve an additional J chain in this process
#### IgA secretion
![[Pasted image 20260219153552.png]]

#### Distribution of Ab isotypes
Distribution of AG isotypes in body.
- IgG and IgM predominate in plasma.
- IgG and monomeric IgA are the main isotypes in extracellular fluid.
- Dimeric IgA predominates in secretions across epithelia, including breast milk.
- The fetus receives IgG by transplacental transfer.
- IgE is found mostly near to epithelial
- Surfaces, especially gut, lungs and skin. The brain is normally free from Ab

### Ab function - Blocking

#### Promoting antigen phagocytosis
![[Pasted image 20260219153900.png]]
Mast cell degranulation - allergy

### Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC)
![[Pasted image 20260219154020.png]]
Antibody-antigen complexes. An important mechanism for clearing soluble antigens. Taken up by phagocytes. Note, importantly, that high levels of Ab-Ag complexes are prevalent in some autoimmune disease, major cause of glomerulonephritis

### Monoclonal Antibodies
(mAbs)
Laboratory-produced, identical copies of specific immune system proteins designed to bind to, detect, or destroy specific antigens, such as cancer cells, pathogens, or hormones.
