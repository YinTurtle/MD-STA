### LO
- Identify the two main divisions of the ANS and their relationship to the rest of the nervous system.
- Characterise each branch of the ANS by their basic anatomical location, pathways and targets organs.
- Know the general physiological consequences of sympathetic or parasympathetic innervation.
- Propose the effects of stimulating or antagonising each branch of the ANS based on their generalised functions.
- Recognise the two-neuron system of innervation and the main neurotransmitters involved in both branches of the ANS.
- To know that drugs which affect the synthesis, storage, release and termination of acetylcholine effects at the skeletal neuromuscular junction also affect the ANS.

Somatic - limbs control (conscious)
Visceral - system responses (unconscious)
Enteric - gut control (heavily influenced by ANS)

### Somatic and ANS
![[Pasted image 20260219101308.png]]
Ganglion - group of neural cell bodies outside the CNS, located within the PNS

### 2 neuron systems
##### Pre-ganglionic
Fibres originate from CNS
##### Post-ganglionic
Fibres originate from autonomic ganglia
![[Pasted image 20260219101551.png]]
- 2 neurone system - repeated because it is important
- Thoracolumbar - leave CNS in the thorax and upper lumbar region
	- short pre-ganglionic, long post ganglionic
- Craniosacral - leave CNS in the head via cranial nerves (CN III, VII, IX, X) and from sacral segments of the spinal cord
	- long pre-ganglionic, short post-ganglionic

### Body nerve system
#### Parasympathetic
![[Pasted image 20260219101727.png]]
Cranial X is the vagus nerve, innervates cervical and thoracic vertebrae columns of the body. (Vagus means wanderer)

#### Sympathetic
![[Pasted image 20260219101930.png]]

### Sympathetic nerve fibres exiting the CNS
![[Pasted image 20260219102339.png]]

**4** options for a sympathetic fibre exiting the CNS
![[Pasted image 20260219130137.png]]
- **Synapse in the sympathetic chain at the same spinal level** → post-ganglionic fibre returns to the spinal nerve to supply body wall/limbs.
- **Ascend or descend in the sympathetic chain, then synapse** (e.g., to reach cervical or sacral levels) → post-ganglionic fibres go to targets at those levels.
- **Pass through the sympathetic chain without synapsing → synapse in a prevertebral (pre-aortic) ganglion** → post-ganglionic fibres go to abdominal/pelvic organs.
- **Go directly to the adrenal medulla**: pre-ganglionic fibres synapse on **chromaffin cells**, which release adrenaline/noradrenaline into blood.

### Autonomic motor reflex
Autonomic visceral reflexes afferent fibres accompany parasympathetic fibres.

### Visceral afferents and Referred pain
- Sensation of pain felt in a body part other than its actual source - caused by brain misinterpreting pain signals from shared neural pathways
- Visceral pain will travel along (same route) with sympathetic nerve supply.

| ------------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| Heart              | ↓ heart rate             | ↑ heart rate<br>↑ force of contraction      |
| Digestive tract    | ↑ motility and secretion | ↓ motility and secretion                    |
| Lungs              | bronchoconcstriction     | bronchodilation                             |

### ANS and the eye
**Pupillary dilator muscle** - *sympathetic* innervation only
- ###### Mydriasis
**Pupillary constrictor muscle** - *parasympathetic* innervation
- ###### Miosis
![[Pasted image 20260219104541.png]]

What effect would a **sympathetic** *agonist* have on the eye?
Mydriasis (dilation)
What effect would a **parasympathetic** *antagonist* have on the eye?
Mydriasis (dilation)

### ANS and the urinary bladder
When bladder is filling
	**Sympathetic** control predominates
		- Relaxation of detrusor muscle
		- Contraction of internal sphincter muscle
When bladder if full
	**Parasympathetic** control predominates
		- Contraction of detrusor muscle
		- Relaxation of internal sphincter muscle

### Basic physiology of the ANS
**Sympathetic** and **parasympathetic** innervation
- may oppose or compliment
- may (rarely) have the same effect (e.g. saliva)
- some tissues only innervated by one

The effects of innervation can be generalised
- **parasympathetic** - "rest and digest"
- **sympathetic** - "fight or flight"

*Autonomic reflex arc* exist for visceral control
- path of afferent fibres can explain referred pain

#### Varicosities
Varicosities in the ANS are bead-like enlargements along postganglionic axons that function as sites for storing and releasing neurotransmitters (such as norepinephrine, ATP and acetylcholine) directly onto target effector tissues.

### CNS Overall
![[Pasted image 20260219105532.png]]

### Sympathetic innervation of the adrenal gland
- Preganglionic sympathetic fibers synapse on chromaffin cells

- Chromaffin cells release adrenaline (~80%) and noradrenaline (~20%) into systemic circulation

- Widespread tissue response
![[Pasted image 20260219130257.png]]

### Neurotransmitters of the ANS
- *All* pre-ganglionic neurons in the **parasympathetic** sympathetic system release ACh
	- Nicotinic receptors
- All postganglionic **parasympathetic** neurons release ACh
	- Muscarinic receptors
- Most postganglionic sympathetic neurons release noradrenaline
	- Some release ACh (i.e. sweat glands)

Adrenal gland does not synapsed but rather directly innervates from the nerve roots.
