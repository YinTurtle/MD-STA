### LO
- To understand the physical and chemical barriers that provide defence against infection.
- To understand how the innate immune system works in a both rapidly and non-specifically, and with no memory.
- To identify and describe the cells involved in the innate immune system.
- To describe the complement pathway.
- To describe the various recognition systems used by the innate immune system.

### 3 Phases of response to initial infection

### Pathogens access
![[Pasted image 20260219091832.png]]
Mucosal surfaces are most vulnerable to infections. The GI tract is the most likely route of entry - through ingestion.

### Barriers to Infection
#### Mechanical
- Tight junctions between cells prevents access
- Air and fluid flow across epithelium
- Movement of mucus by cilia
#### Chemical
- Fatty acids on skin
- Enzymes: lysozyme in saliva, sweat and tears.
- Low pH in stomach
- Antibacterial peptides: defensins (skin and gut) cryptidins (gut)
#### Microbiological
- Normal flora compete for nutrients and attachment (biofilms), and also produce antibacterial substances (colicins).

### Innate Immunity
- Once across an Innate immunity epithelial barrier, in most cases microorganisms are recognised and ingested by mononuclear phagocytes, or macrophages.

Bactericidal effects and agents produced by phagocytes
- Acidification: pH 3-4, bactericidal
- Toxic oxygen derived products: superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical
- Toxic nitrogen oxides: Nitric Oxide
- Peptides: defensins and other cationic proteins
- Enzymes: **Lysosyme**, acid hydrolases
- Competitors: Lactoferrin, vitamin B12 binding protein.

Cells of the Immune System. All cellular elements of blood, rbc, platelets, white cells derive from the same progenitor - hematopoietic stem cell

### Monocytes
One of the three types of phagocytic cell of the immune system. Circulate in bloodstream, differentiate into macrophages in tissue.

### Neutrophils
- Overall represents around 70% of all circulating white blood cells
- The neutrophils are very short lived (~12 hours in circulation). If it starts crashing, it indicates that there is something wrong with the bone marrow.

### Eosinophils
- Evolutionarily important in parasite defence
![[Pasted image 20260219095056.png]]

### Basophils
- Also a granuloctye, function probably similar and complementary to eosinophils and mast cells.
- Least common PMN
- When activation secrete histamine, proteoglycans, leucotrienes, some cytokines including IL-4 (potentially important for IgE and allergy)

### Mast Cells
- When activated release a number of substances that effect vascular systems. Most well known due to IgE mediated triggering in allergies

### Lymphocytes, either B or T
- Within these populations lie the adaptive immune response - B cells producing antibody, T cells becoming cytotoxic T cells (CD8) or helper T cells (CD4).

### Dendritic cells
- Potentially the most important immune cell, bridges the innate and adaptive immune responses. Specialised in antigen uptake and antigen presentation
![[Pasted image 20260219093407.png]]

### Natural Killer
- Large granular lymphocytes that can recognise virally infected cells non-specifically
- Early defence role against viral infection
- Difference between NK and CD8 T cells is that NK cells are not antigen specific.
- Do not require to undergo lengthy clonal expansion of T cells in lymph nodes when virus is detected

### 3 Complement Pathways Cascade
- Heat labile component of plasma that act in concert with antibodies to kill some bacteria
- Comprises a large number of distinct plasma proteins
- Three distinct activation pathways exist that trigger the complement cascade
#### Classical Pathway
- Antibody binds to specific antigen
#### Lectin Pathway
- Mennose-binding protein binds to pathogen surface
#### Alternative Pathway
- Pathogen surface

#### Complement protein function

| Function                               | Protein       |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Membrane-binding proteins and opsonins | C3b, C4b      |
| Peptide mediators of inflammation      | C5a, C3a, C4a |

- C3 splits into C3a and C3b. C3b bonds to microbial surface (called opsonins).
- C3b bound to cell surface acts to increase phagocytosis, for example by complement receptor, expressed on macrophages and PMNs.
- C5a assists in the phagocytosis of C3b covered bacteria.

### Membrane pore

### Clinical Setting
- When a patient presents with an inflammatory response, steroids are often given first, which reduces the inflammatory response
	- However steroids are immuno-suppressive
