### LO
- List aims of medicine regulation
- Understand the significance of prescribing medicines unlicenced or off-label
- List the legal categories of medicines in the UK
- Summarise general principles of safe and legal prescribing
- Summarise the routes available to report adverse events involving medicines
- Explain the role of evidence based guidelines
- Explain the role of medicine formularies

### Medicines Regulators
MHRA -> UK
Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency
- Approves and licenses meds in the UK - issues Clinical Trial Authorisations and Marketing Authorisations
- Power to withdraw meds from market
- Monitors safety
- Issues manufacturers and wholesale dealers' licences

#### MHRA
- Ensures standard, safety, quality and efficacy.
- The terms of this specifies what sort of conditions and patients the medicine is licenced for, as described in Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC)
https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/

### Unlicensed or off-label medicines
- **Unlicensed** - no Marketing authorisations, includes "special/bespoke" formulations, imported drugs and chemicals
- **Off-label** - has a marketing authorisation but prescribed outwith the terms of licence (different dose, age of patient, indication, route, contra-indication)

Ensure patient is aware the medicine is being used outwith license ("label"). Ensure sufficient evidence and benefits outweighing risk. Document and justify reasons for prescribing.

### Off-label Thalidomide use
- Marketed as sedative - became over the counter (OTC) in late 1950's but used off-label for morning sickness
- Resulted in malformations of limbs and other development problems for babies

### UK Medicine legislation
- Medicine Act 1968 – Provided legal framework regarding control of medicines in UK.
- Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 – prohibits activities around certain drugs
- Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001 – to allow for possession & supply of “controlled drugs” for legitimate purposes.
- Human Medicines Regulations 2012 – simplified set of rules, introduced pharmacovigilance requirements

#### Misuse of Drugs Act 1971
- Aims to prevent misuse of potentially dangerous drugs by applying penalties to their manufacture, supply or possession
- Separated drugs into 3 class
	- **Class A** - cocaine, heroin, methadone, magic mushrooms
	- **Class B** - cannabis, mephedrone
	- **Class C** - anabolic steroids, benzodiazepines

Not all legal drugs are safe
- Alcohol
- Nicotine
- Gases, aerosols etc

#### Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001
- Specifies import, export, production, supply, possession, prescribing, record keeping activities for controlled drugs (CDs)
	- 5 Schedules of CDs:
		- Schedule 1 - lysergide
		- Schedule 2 - opiates
		- Schedule 3 - some benzodiazepines
		- Schedule 4 - anabolic steroids
		- Schedule 5 - codeine
- Requires the signing of the prescriber
	- Be aware of drug misuse
	- Emphasises importance of early review if these drugs are started
	- Monitoring

#### Human Medicines Regulations 2012
- Consolidated and modernised set of rules in line with EU laws
- Clearer pharmacovigilance routes

### 3 legal categories of medicines (UK)
GSL - General Sales List
P - Pharmacy Only
POM - Prescription Only Medicine

#### General Sales List (GSL)
- Can be sold in registered pharmacies, but can be found anywhere (other retail outlets)
	- e.g. paracetamol
	- Over the counter

#### Pharmacy (P) Only
- Sold from registered pharmacy premises by a pharmacist or a person acting under the supervision of a pharmacist
	- "P" medicines - not for public self-selection
	- Additional legal/professional considerations
	- Check for contra-indications
- Practitioners can also prescribe this

#### Prescription Only Medicine (POM)
- Written by an "appropriate practitioner" before it can be sold or supplied
	- Doctor, dentist, nurse independent prescriber, supplementary prescriber, pharmacist independent prescriber, community practitioner nurses etc
- Some medicines may have more than one category of classification (depending on formulation, strength, quantity, indication or marketing authorisation).
- An increasing number of medicines reclassified from POM to P - improving access to medicines with safety net of Pharmacists

### General principles
- Prescriber is responsible for prescription
- Must explain and justify reason to prescribe including off-label/unlicensed use
- Keep up to date
- Work within limits of competence
- De-prescribe (reduce/stop) when appropriate

### Prescription writing
- Signed by ink by appropriate practitioner
- Proper stationary
- Name and address of patient (including particulars)
- Dated
- Can be computer printed, but the signature needs to be signed physically

#### Controlled drugs (CDs)
- Some schedules limited to supply of up to 30 days
- Valid for 28 days from the appropriate date
- Specify formulation, dose and strength
- Total amount in words and figures

#### Safe Prescribing
- Right
	- Patient, drug, dose, route, time
- No abbreviations and Latin (but in the real world, prescribers do use abbreviations)

##### Dangers
Recent cases fatal outcomes due to being wrongly prescribed, dispensed or adminstered
- Could be caused by sound-a-likes or look-a-likes
	- e.g. Risperidone (antipsychotic) instead of Ropinerole (Parkinson med)
		- Propranolol (beta-blocker for angina) instead of Prednisolone (steroid)

### Pharmacovigilance - Post Marketing Surveillance
- MHRA Yellow Card Scheme
	- Report suspected adverse reactions to any therapeutic agent
![[Pasted image 20260216114237.png]]
- "Upside down black triangle" drugs ![[Pasted image 20260216114029.png|20]]
	- Newly licenced medicines that require intensive monitoring

#### Reporting Systems
- Report any errors or near misses in prescribing, dispensing, administration, and monitoring of medicines
- "DATIX" is the NHS Fife reporting system
	- Web-based risk management system in the NHS and healthcare sectors for reporting, managing and analysing incidents, near misses and safety concerns.

### Evidence Based Clinical Guidelines
- Result of systematic review of multi-disciplinary teams
- Recommend management and treatment options
- Support and maximise efficacy
- Reduces variation in practice
- Maximise safety
- Most general guideline:
	- If it is not SMC approved, don't provide it

### Role of Medicine Formularies
- List of prescription drugs used by practitioners to identify drugs that offer the greatest overall value in terms of safety, efficacy and cost
- Up to date and evidence based
https://formulary.nhs.scot/east

#### UK Formularies
- BNF
	- Online british national formulary
#### Individual Country medicine advice
- Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC)
	- Independent, multi-professional
	- Analyses health benefits of meds
	- Compares to other treatments
	- Is it good value for money?
	- Should it be used by NHS Scotland?
