#ethics 

### LO
- to discuss reasons people may not want to talk about death and the effect this can have on healthcare decisions
- to understand what palliative care is and outline the values of the hospice movement
- to identify the different categories of euthanasia (by choice and by action)
- to reflect on the significance of actions, omissions, intentions and consequences morally
- to be aware of the availability and regulation of euthanasia in the Netherlands, Switzerland and Oregon (in the US)
- to explain the change in arrangements in the UK surrounding organ donation: opt in and opt out.

### Discussing death
- discomfort, distance, dispute, regrets
- disbelief (in diagnosis), disinterested, misplaced hope

### Hospice movement
Based on *“a concept where there is a shift of  emphasis from conventional care that focuses on  quantity of life, towards a commitment to care which  enhances the quality of life.”* (p1, The Hospice  Movement, Help the Hospices)
- The focus of care in the hospice (palliative care) is  based on a holistic view of the person:
	- Physical
	- Emotional
	- Psychological
	- Spiritual
	- Social
- Often a focus on pain management (with the conception of ‘total pain’)

> [!info] 
> Palliative care that which relieves the symptoms of a disease or condition without dealing with the underlying cause (OED - outpatient emergency department)

- Medical decisions at the end of life is also applied by the same ethical principles
	- autonomy
	- beneficence
	- non-maleficence
	- justice
- law, and sanctity of life

### Ending life: terminology
> [!info]
> Active euthanasia and assisted suicide is illegal in the UK. Passive euthanasia is allowed.

- *Euthanasia*: X intentionally kills Y, or permits Y’s death, for Y’s benefit
- *Active euthanasia*: X **performs** an action which itself results in Y’s death (so like X directly administer life ending agent to Y)
- *Passive euthanasia*: X allows Y to die. X **withholds** life prolonging treatment or **withdraws** life-prolonging treatment
- *Voluntary euthanasia*: Euthanasia when Y competently **requests** death themselves
- *Non-voluntary euthanasia*: Euthanasia when Y is **not competent** to express a preference
- *Involuntary euthanasia*: Death is **against** Y’s competent wishes, although X permits or imposes death for Y’s benefit
- *Suicide*: Y intentionally kills himself
- *Assisted suicide*: X intentionally helps Y to kill himself (Y performs the final action to die)
- *Murder*: X intentionally kills Y
--- 
* NHS Choices (2018): “Euthanasia is the act of deliberately ending a  person's life to relieve suffering”

### Why is passive euthanasia acceptable, and active not?
- **Action vs. Omission:** Passive euthanasia is viewed as an omission - stopping treatment that prolongs life, allowing the underlying disease to cause death. Active euthanasia is a deliberate, direct commission (e.g., lethal injection).
- **Intent and Morality:** The moral difference often centers on the intention of the actor: to relieve suffering by letting a patient die, rather than to kill.
- **Medical Duty:** Passive euthanasia is seen as aligning with the goal of not providing "officious" or futile, painful, or burdensome care when a patient is dying.
- **Legal/Ethical Frameworks:** In many places, removing life support is legal, while active intervention is prohibited, often described as homicide or against the doctor's duty to protect life

### Pain relief and doctrine of double effect (DDE)
- You cannot give a drug with the intention to kill  another person
- However, increasing doses of painkiller can be given  to alleviate pain, with the possibility of causing death
- This involves looking at the distinction between intending death, and foreseeing death
- As well as ethically noting a difference between  intending and foreseeing…

### Active euthanasia
#### For
- consistency
- more effective
- patient's choice - autonomy and beneficence
- benefits of regulation
#### Against
- respect for sanctity of life
- palliative care - other options
- exploitation/manipulation
- contrary to aims of medicine 'fire do no harm'
- slippery slope

### Ending-life
#### Netherlands
Euthanasia is allowed if:
- Patient is incurably ill
- Patient is experiencing unbearable suffering
- Patient has requested his/her life be terminated
- Termination is performed by the patient’s own doctor

Three points to note:
- Advance directives for euthanasia are allowed
- Children from 1-12 can have their life ended if suffering unbearably without prospect of improvement; over the age of 12 children can request euthanasia
- Euthanasia of severely disabled newborns is allowed
#### Switzerland
- Assisted suicide is legally condoned
- Assisting someone to commit suicide is illegal ONLY if the  motive is selfish; if the motive is unselfish, then it is NOT illegal
- Two organisations which help people to die are
	- EXIT
	- Dignitas
- The person assisting does not have to be a physician, person being assisted does not need to be a resident of Switzerland
~ 300 suicides per year are assisted by right-to-die organisations in Switzerland
#### Oregon (USA)
- Death with Dignity Act 1994
- Physician-assisted suicide is legal in Oregon. Doctors may prescribe medication that allows voluntary self-administration of lethal dosage by the patient
- **Not** euthanasia (x intentionally kills y for y’s benefit). Euthanasia is illegal in the US, PAS varies from state-to-state
- Only applies to residents of Oregon (2023 amendment attempted to reverse this)

### Organ Donation
- UK has recently moved away from ‘opt-in’ systems of organ donation to ‘opt-out’ systems
- Aimed at increasing number of donors

- Wales from 2015 – ‘deemed consent’. If you haven’t registered an organ and tissue donation decision, you will be considered to have no objection
- England from 2020 – All adults now considered to have agreed to be an organ donor, unless they have recorded a decision not to donate or are in an excluded group
- Scotland from 2021 – ‘deemed authorisation’. If you have not confirmed whether or not you want to be a donor, you will be considered willing to donate
- Northern Ireland – public consultation in 2021, opt out system from June 2023

*opt-in* = actively choose to be an organ donor.
*opt-out* = you are already an organ donor, you have to actively ask to be excluded

Reasons why potential donors don't become actual donors include:
- Tests for brainstem death not carried out
- Refusal by relatives
- Medical contraindication to donation
- Relatives not asked about donation
- Heart stopped beating before brainstem death complete
- Organs offered but not retrieved

Do not allow directed/conditional donation. Only allowed if it is a living donor, like giving a second kidney etc.
