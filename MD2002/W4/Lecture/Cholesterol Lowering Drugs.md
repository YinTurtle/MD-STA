### LO
- To describe the sources of cholesterol in the blood and how it is tranported
- To recognise the association of high blood cholesterol levels with atherosclerosis
- To relate the mechanisms of action of the main types of lipid lowering drugs to the therapeutic outcome
- To identify the major side effects of the different types of lipid-lowering agents

### Outline
- Lipoproteins
- Atherosclerosis
- Lipid-lowering drugs
	- Common pathways
	- Lesser-spotted but still clinically relevant

### Lipoproteins
Central core of hydrophobic lipid
- triglycerides or cholesterol esters

Hydrophilic coat of polar substances
- phospholipids
- free cholesterol
- associated proteins
	- apoproteins or apolipoproteins
![[Pasted image 20260218091155.png]]

Five main classes, vary in
- core lipids
- apoproteins
- size
- density

1) High density lipoproteins (HDL)
2) Intermediate density lipoproteins (IDL)
3) Low density lipoproteins (LDL)
4) Very low density lipoproteins (VLDL)
5) Chylomicrons

### Exogenous pathway
(gut-> chylomicrons -> remnants -> liver)
- Adding bile acids is able to get rid of excess cholesterol
	- Bile acids can be reabsorbed into the liver
Steps:
1. Intestine packages dietary lipids into **chylomicrons** (TG + cholesterol esters).
2. In capillaries, **LPL** splits TG → **free fatty acids** go into muscle/adipose.
3. Leftover **chylomicron remnants** are taken up by the **liver**.
4. In the liver, that cholesterol can be **stored**, **converted to bile acids**, or **repackaged into VLDL** (which feeds back into the endogenous pathway).

### Endogenous pathway
(liver -> VLDL -> IDL/LDL)
- HMG CoA reductase is the rate lowering enzyme
Steps:
1. **Liver makes VLDL** to export **newly synthesised TG + cholesterol** to tissues.
2. In capillaries, **lipoprotein lipase (LPL)** removes TG → releases **free fatty acids** to muscle/adipose.
3. As TG is removed, VLDL is remodeled and you end up with particles that become **LDL**, which is **cholesterol-rich**.
4. **LDL is taken up by cells or liver** (via LDL receptors).

### Lipoproteins cycle
Chylomicrons transport TG and cholesterol esters from the GI to tissues
- Split by lipoprotein lipase to release free fatty acids (FFAs)
- FFAs taken up by muscle and adipose tissue
Chylomicron remnants taken up in the liver
- Cholesterol stored, oxidised to bile acids or released to VLDL
VLDL transport cholesterol and newly synthesised TG to tissues
- TGs removed from VLDL leaving LDL with a high cholesterol (taken up by cells or liver)
HDL absorbs cholesterol from cell breakdown and transfer it to VLDL.

### Lipoprotein Metabolism
Increase in plasma cholesterol associated with increase of LDL is a risk factor for atheromatous disease.
An increase in plasma concentration of lipids is called hyperlipidaemia.

### Lipid Lowering Drug
Work either by reducing production of lipoproteins or by increasing their removal from the blood.
**Aim** is to reduce plasma cholesterol
- First step is lifestyle modification (e.g. diet and exercise)
- Drug therapy should be secondary
#### Cholesterol derived from 3 sources
- De novo synthesis in liver (endogenous pathway)
- Uptake form circulating LDLs
- Uptake of chylomicron remnants

### Action of drugs
- Sequester bile acids in the intestine/Decrease hepatic stores of cholesterol
	- e.g. bile acid sequestrants
- Enhance the removal of LDL
	- e.g. PCSK9 inhibitors
- Inhibit transport protein for cholesterol in the brush border of enterocytes in the duodenum
	- e.g. ezetimibe
- Alter the levels of plasma lipoproteins
	- e.g. fibrates
- Inhibit the synthesis of cholesterol in the liver
	- e.g. statins, bempedoic acid

### Statins
Inhibit HMG-CoA reductase - which decreases cholesterol synthesis - results in lowering of LDL
#### HMG-CoA reductase
- Major rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis
- Converts HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid (MVA)
#### Atorvastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin, and rosuvastatin
- Long lasting HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors
#### Clinical uses of Statins
- Secondary prevention of myocardial infarction and stroke in those who have atherosclerotic diseases
- Primary prevention of arterial disease in patients with high serum cholesterol
- Atorvastatin lowers serum cholesterol in familial hypercholesterolaemia
##### If Statins don't work?
**Ezetimibe**
- Specifically reduces intestinal cholesterol absorption by inhibiting a sterol carrier protein in the brush border of the enterocytes

**Bempedoic acid**
- Reduces cholesterol synthesis in the liver by inhibiting ATP citrate lyase (which converts citrate to acetyl-CoA).
- Inhibits ATP citrate lyase - which decreases cholesterol synthesis upstream of HMG-CoA reductase

**PCSK9 Inhibitors**
- PCSK9 mediates the degradation of LDL receptors on surface of liver cells, inhibiting this enzyme increases the amount of LDL bound and removed by the liver.
- **Alirocumab and Evolocumab**
	- Monoclonal antibodies that block PCSK9, preventing it from marking LDL-receptors for destruction
- **Inclisiran**
	- Small interfering RNA which limits PCK9 production

### Fibrates - activators of lipoprotein lipase
**Fenofibrate, gemfibrozol**
-  ↓plasma triglycerides and, to a lesser extent, cholesterol
- Particularly ↓ elevated concentrations of VLDL
- Main action is stimulation of lipoprotein lipase which ↓ the triglyceride content of VLDL
- Clearance of LDL by the liver is also stimulated
- ↑ HDL production and reverse cholesterol transport

#### Clinical uses of fibrates
Patients with:
- Diabetes
- Mixed dyslipidaemia
- Elevated LDL cholesterol
- High cardiovascular risk
- Marked hypertriglyceridaemia
- Low HDL cholesterol

### Colestyramine

### Side effect of lipid lowering drugs
**Statins** - Myositis, angio-oedema, GI disturbances, insomnia, rash. Strictly contra-indicated in pregnancy
**Bempedoic acid** - Anaemia, gout, hyperuricaemia
**PCSK9 inhibitors** - Flu-like symptoms, muscle pain
**Fibrates** - Myositis (especially in patients with renal impairment), GI disturbances
**Colestyramine, ezetimibe** - GI symptoms (nausea, abdominal bloating, constipation, diarrhoea)

> [!info] Target drugs on endogenous (liver/LDL handling)
> - **Statins**: inhibit **HMG-CoA reductase** → ↓ cholesterol synthesis (mevalonate pathway) → lowers LDL.
>- **Bempedoic acid**: inhibits **ATP citrate lyase** → ↓ cholesterol synthesis upstream of HMG-CoA reductase.
>- **PCSK9 inhibitors** (alirocumab, evolocumab) / **inclisiran**: reduce LDL-receptor degradation → **more LDL receptors** → **more LDL removed by liver**.
>- **Fibrates**: mainly affect TG/VLDL by stimulating **LPL** and altering lipoproteins (↓ TG; especially ↓ VLDL; some effects on LDL/HDL per slide).
>- **Bile acid sequestrant (colestyramine)**: binds bile acids in gut → prevents enterohepatic recycling → liver uses more cholesterol to make bile acids + increases LDL receptor numbers → ↓ LDL

Endogenous pathway drugs = **reduce synthesis** (statins/bempedoic acid) or **increase hepatic clearance** (PCSK9 inhibitors/inclisiran), and **reduce TG-rich particles** (fibrates).

> [!info] Target drugs on exogenous (gut absorption)
> **Ezetimibe**: reduces **intestinal cholesterol absorption** by inhibiting a brush-border sterol transport protein in enterocytes

Exogenous pathway drugs = **block absorption** (ezetimibe) or **trap bile acids** (colestyramine).
