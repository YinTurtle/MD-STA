### LO
- To identify the risk factors for atherosclerosis
- To explain the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis
- To identify and explain the morphology of atheroma
- To discuss about clinical features and prevention of atherosclerosis

### Definitions
- Atherosclerosis
	- Chronic, plaque - comprised of fat, cholesterol, calcium and cellular waste - builds up inside artery walls, making them thicken and harden, causing the arteries to become more narrow
- Atheroma
	- Accumulation of fatty, fibrous plaque on the inner walls of arteries, causing **Atherosclerosis**

### Risk Factors
- Age, sex, genetics, hyperlipidaemia, hypertension, smoking, diabetes mellitus

### Chronic Endothelial Injury/Dysfunction

- Increase Endothelial permeability 
- Increase Leukocyte adhesion
	- Vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1)
	- Intercellular adhesion molecule1 (ICAM-1)
		- P-selectin
		- E-selectin
- Increase Monocyte adhesion and migration

### Role of Lipids
- Hyperlipidaemia (LDL cholesterol)
	- Impairs endothelial function
	- Accumulates within intima
	- Causes oxidative modification of LDL:
		- Ingested by macrophages via SCAVANGER receptors = foam cells
		- Chemotactic for monocytes
		- Inhibit the motility of macrophages
		- Stimulates release of cytokines
		- Cytotoxic to endothelial and smooth muscle cells
### Role of Macrophages
- Engulf oxidised LDL = foam cells

### Role of Smooth Muscles Proliferation
- Collagen and Extracellular matrix deposition
- Fatty streak - becomes mature fibro-fatty atheroma

### Overall process of Atheroma
![[Pasted image 20260218102730.png]]
Atheromatous (fibro-fatty, fibro-lipid) plaque
- Patchy and raised white to yellow 0.3-1.5cm
- Core of lipid
- Fibrous cap (smooth muscle + collagen)

#### Plaque growth
A) *Stable* plaque
- thick fibrous cap
- gradual narrowing (stenosis)
	- chronic ischemia (e.g. angina)
B) *Unstable* plaque
- Thin cap + lots of inflammation
- cap can rupture
	- clot forms
	- acute events (MI, stroke)

**Can be found in:**
- Abdominal aorta
- Coronary arteries
- Popliteal arteries
- Descending thoracic aorta
- Internal carotid arteries
- Vessels of the circle of Willis

**Complicated lesions:**
- Calcification
- Rupture or ulceration
- Haemorrhage
- Thrombosis
- Aneurysmal dilatation

- Crystallisation of the macrophages and cholesterol

### Clinical Features
- Only if complications:
	- Thrombosis
	- Calcification
	- Aneurysmal dilatation
	- Ischaemic events:
		- Heart
		- Brain
		- Lower extremities
		- Other organ
