### LO
- Appreciate that others, whether patients or healthcare professionals, may hold different values and beliefs
- Outline the arguments for and against conscientious objection in the practice of medicine
- Recognise why medical students have different guidelines on conscientious objection to medical doctors
- State four reasons why some argue that conscientious objection should not be allowed in medical practice
- Recognise situations where differences in values and beliefs may lead to potential discrepancies in patient care and identify appropriate responses to these cases

1. Read the opening 8 paragraphs of Rethinking Conscientious Objection in Health Care by Giubilini et al. (2025)1 – stop at the sentence ‘These two claims constitute the main thesis that we are going to defend in this book’ (you may of course read on, but you don’t have to). Then answer the following questions:
	1. How would the book’s opening anecdote [para 1-2] fail the GMC’s guidelines on conscientious objection?
		Under GMC guidance, a doctor who has a conscientious objection can’t let it become a barrier to a patient getting appropriate care, and must manage it in a way that avoids judgement, distress, discrimination, and obstruction. Refusing healthcare to a certain specific group is discrimination.
	2. Why might this be an example still worth considering [para 3]?
		Because the authors argue the case isn’t a one-off and will likely grow as societies become more pluralistic and the menu of contested interventions expands. So even if the anecdote feels “extreme,” it’s being used as a representative risk for real systems: access, equity, and regulation pressures.
	3. How do they define the patient they are concerned with [para 4-5]?
		To be decisionally competent, eligible to receive a particular health care service, and autonomously requests the particular health care service.
	4. How do they define conscientious objection [para 6]?
		Refusing action.
	5. What are the two problems with conscientious objection that they identify [para 7-8]?
		- CO is often exercised/allowed on the basis of personal moral beliefs, and that becomes problematic when it clashes with eligible patients’ legitimate interests in adequate/available care or with professional standards.
		- It’s not the clinician’s prerogative at the bedside to decide whether the law is ethically right/wrong, nor to act on their own ethical assessment when it departs from currently accepted professional standards (assuming those standards rest on sound professional ethics).
2. What four arguments does Julian Savulescu’s article give against conscientious objection?
	- Inefficiency & inequity (CO makes access depend on which doctor you happen to meet)
		- Strengths:
			- Really strong when delays cause harm (time-sensitive care, geographically sparse services).
			- Highlights structural unfairness - patients least able to navigate systems lose out.
		- Weaknesses / pushback:
			- If a system guarantees easy, rapid access (robust referral pathways, enough providers), inequity/inefficiency may be mitigated.
			- Doesn’t by itself prove no CO - could support “CO only if no access impact.”
	- Inconsistency (why privilege conscience/religion when we reject other value-based refusals?)
		- Strengths:
			- Powerful “equal treatment of reasons” challenge: forces a principled line, not special pleading.
		- Weaknesses / pushback:
			- Some will argue conscience-based refusals are about moral complicity (doing wrongdoing) while “over-70s” is discriminatory rationing; not the same kind of reason.
			- Risk-based refusal in epidemics is sometimes addressed via occupational safety duties - not purely “self-interest vs conscience.”
	- Professional commitments (if you won’t provide core legal care, choose a different role)
		- Strengths:
			- Clear on professionalism as a voluntary role with obligations (helps avoid “I want the title but not the duties”).
			- Works well for specialties where the contested procedure is central.
		- Weaknesses / pushback:
			- Medicine is broad; some objections concern a narrow set of procedures - critics say the “then don’t be a doctor” line can be overly blunt.
			- Could shrink workforce if applied rigidly, especially in underserved areas.
	- Discrimination (treating religious values as “special” is unfair to secular moral views)
		- Strengths:
			- Strong liberal-equality point: the state shouldn’t privilege one kind of conscience claim over another.
		- Weaknesses / pushback:
			- Some legal frameworks protect religion explicitly; others protect “conscience” broadly - so the force of the argument depends on the jurisdiction’s rights architecture.
			- Even if true, it may support “equalize exemptions” rather than “abolish exemptions.”
3. One issue with conscientious objection is that it can be abused by bad faith actors. Read Cook and Dickens’s short article on the subject. Do you think that this is a problem for the principle of conscientious objection, or just its practice?
	Cook & Dickens argue that “conscience” can be expanded and strategically used to justify refusals that go well beyond narrow non-participation - e.g., refusal to counsel, inform, or refer - creating serious access harms.
	- Some people use conscience as a cover for discrimination, moral judgement, punishing patient, or generally just avoiding work.
	- They may stretch CO to avoid even misleading, misinforming, blocking access etc
		- This abuse could come in practice as the rules in place may not necessarily reflect on them harming the patients in such ways. Furthermore it is difficult to prove 'blocking access' to patients.
		- It can become a problem for the principle of CO as if CO becomes more predictable in such scenarios, the weak rules produces foreseeable harm (stigmas, delays etc).
		- Bad faith is primarily a practice problem, but it pressures the principle to be narrowly defined and tightly regulated - otherwise the principle becomes indistinguishable from enabling obstruction/discrimination.
		- If CO is allowed at all, it needs enforceable safeguards, e.g.:
			- no moralising/judgement,
			- transparency in advance (declared objections),
			- duty to provide accurate information,
			- duty to ensure effective access (rapid referral/signposting),
			- accountability when access is harmed.
4. Some ethicists argue that conscientious objection is acceptable in certain circumstances. The Box below is taken from Morten Magelssen’s paper ‘When should conscientious objection be accepted?’. Go through the criteria Magelssen lists. Consider how the example of medical practitioners objecting to termination of pregnancy: can objecting to this procedure meet the criteria? Write down your thoughts on each point. Are there areas where meeting the criteria is difficult?

	Thoughts on abortion context
		Can it meet it? Yes, often. Many clinicians’ abortion objections are core to their moral/religious identity (they see participation as killing).
		What makes it tricky:
			“Deep conviction” can be asserted too easily—so you need some way to separate serious integrity claims from preference, prejudice, or convenience.
		Where it’s difficult: proving depth/sincerity without making tribunals “judge beliefs” is awkward.
	Plausible, coherent moral rationale
		Can it meet it? Often yes. A coherent rationale can be built from fetal moral status, non-maleficence, etc.
		Hard part: “plausible” is contested:
		Some will say a rationale must be publicly defensible (not just “my religion says so”).
		Others accept internally coherent religious reasoning as sufficient.
		Difficult zone: the more “plausibility” is tightened, the more CO starts to look like it’s only for certain worldviews.
	Respectful/non-discriminatory stance toward patients
		Can it meet it? In principle yes: a clinician can refuse a procedure while still treating the patient with respect, empathy, and without judgement.
		Hard part (abortion specifically):
		Abortion refusal can feel like moral condemnation (“you’re doing wrong”), even if politely expressed.
		Magelssen (as discussed by others) notes this “moral criticism” may be hard to fully avoid—but can be reduced by sensitive communication.
		Where it’s difficult: in emotionally charged consultations, it’s easy for the refusal to be experienced as stigma.
	Acceptable burden on the patient (access is protected)
		Can it meet it? Sometimes—if there’s a fast, reliable alternative pathway (another clinician/service nearby, minimal delay/cost).
		This is usually the hardest criterion for abortion because:
		abortion is time-sensitive → delays can increase risk and reduce options; in rural areas or where many object, CO can create real barriers (travel, waiting, cost, privacy risk).
		Where it’s difficult: when the system is under-resourced, even “polite refusal + referral” can still equal harmful delay.
