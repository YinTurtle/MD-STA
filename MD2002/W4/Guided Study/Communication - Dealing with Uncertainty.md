### LO
- Describe the key challenges in communicating uncertainty and risk to patients
- Demonstrate the use of appropriate language and strategies to explain uncertainty and probabilities
- Critically reflect on the impact of uncertainty on patient understanding, trust, and decision-making
- Use case-based scenarios to practise framing risk in ways that are accurate, empathetic, and tailored to individual patient needs

| **Q. How do patients typically react to uncertainty and risk?**<br><br>- They haven’t interact with the medical procedure before<br><br>- Anxious – body language (unhappy with the situation)<br><br>- Different levels of understanding (so need to explain so the patient can understand)<br><br>- some patient wants to hear everything, some patients wants to hear nothing (Montgomery rule – doctor has to tell the patient and explain all risk, rather than just giving a number)<br><br>- need to personalise the risk (gave example of unable to bend on knees)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| **Q. Where do majority of patients get their information about risk?**<br><br>- Not from well curated sources<br><br>- Some from well researched area<br><br>- Social media, youtube, google – majority are unverified<br><br>- People tend to bring articles or magazines<br><br>- The doctor will push information to patients (email, hard copies etc) – information that are relevant                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Q. What works well when discussing a difficult prognosis?**<br><br>- Explaining a risk – rather than moving around the problem (pianist hand injury example)<br><br>- Controlling your own emotions and reactions – patients respond to the doctor’s facial expression (reassure the patient)<br><br>- Body language (face management)<br><br>- Its ok to say “I don’t know”, to show patient trust (then refer to someone else)<br><br>- Don’t close all of the options (A&E, managing expectations)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Q. How can communication skills be tailored to different patient emotions?**<br><br>- Giving the patient time to process their decisions – especially for complex procedures<br><br>- Give patient double slot depending on the referral<br><br>- Ask the patient to ask questions<br><br>- Give the patient electrical information or hard copy<br><br>- Ask the patient to write down question if they think of a question in between weeks of the slots<br><br>“Doc, what would you do if this was you?”<br><br>-       Need to be careful (as the patient would choose what you would choose, it would be your decision but not the patient, as the options are all valid)<br><br>-       Checking your own biases<br><br>-       You have to walk the patient through to reach a decision they are comfortable with<br><br>-       Leave out irrelevant information if they are uncomfortable hearing, only give important information |

**MD2002  
Workshop: Dealing with Uncertainty and Risk**

Podcast task instructions:

In the workshop, you’ll be asked to reflect on some of the following questions from the podcast discussion:

Risk and uncertainty (3)
-          Complex procedure (not predictable result)
-          Patient has to go through the complexity
-          Both

Don’t want to scare the patient, but also explain (find the fine line)

Find skills where it matches with you, so learn your own strategy

Using metaphors and analogies
- Using them is fine as long as it is in the right situation
- Such as describing a shape, sound etc
- Using images are much better – such as scans, ct, etc
- Plastic models are fine
