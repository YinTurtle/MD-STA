#upperbody/upperlimbs #nerves

### LO
- Describe the Structure of the brachial plexus
- Describe features of the Brachial plexus - from roots to terminal branches
- Describe compartments of the upper limb in terms of their nerve supply
- Describe the dermatomes and myotomes of the upper limb
- Explain how different injuries of the brachial plexus may present

### Brachial Plexus
- Nervous system to supply entire upper limb + all extrinsic back
	- **Except** trapezius (innervated by accessory nerve)
- Made of anterior rami C5-8 and T1
- Pattern:
	- Roots - Trunks - Divisions - Cords - Nerves/Branches
- Travels from the root of the neck, into the axilla - once in the arm, splits into peripheral nerves

#### Roots
These are ventral rami of C5-T1 spinal nerves.
![[Pasted image 20260215221916.png]]
![[Pasted image 20260215221929.png]]
#### Trunks/Divisions
Superior: C5-C6
Middle: C7
Inferior: C8-T1

Each trunk splits further behind the clavicle into:
- Anterior division - flexor/anterior compartment
	- Anterior division of upper and middle trunk -> lateral chord
	- Anterior division of inferior trunk -> medial cord
- Posterior division - extensor/posterior compartment
![[Pasted image 20260215222133.png]]
#### Cords
Named for relation to Axillary artery
- Lateral cord = anterior division of upper + middle trunks
- Posterior cord = all posterior divisions
- Medial cord = anterior division of inferior trunk
![[Pasted image 20260215222841.png]]
#### Terminal Branches
##### Musculocutaneous
- Lateral cord
##### Median Nerve
- Lateral cord & Medial cord
##### Radial (and Axillary) Nerve
- Posterior cord
#### Ulnar Nerve
- Medial cord
![[Pasted image 20260215223126.png]]

The "M" occurs at the anterior to the axillary artery.
#### Major Branches
![[Pasted image 20260215230519.png]]

#### Minor Branches
- Nerve to subclavius
	- A small muscle that anchors and stabilises the clavicle
![[Pasted image 20260215223700.png|800]]
- Nothing to do with the upper limb
	- Phrenic nerve (C5)
	- 1st intercoastal nerve (T1) - supplies the ribs
- Roots
	- *Long thoracic nerve* (C5-7) - goes behind all the roots onto the lateral aspect of the thorax which supplies the muscle serratus anterior
	- *Dorsal scapular nerve* (C5) - supplies rhomboid major and minor (and a bit of levator scapulae)
- Trunks
	- Suprascapular nerve
	- Subclavius nerve
- Divisions
	- No branches in divisions
- Cord
	- Lateral pectoral nerve (C5-7, lateral cord)
		- Supply parts of pectoralis major
	- Upper and lower subscapular nerve supplying subscapularis (C5/6, posterior cord)
		- Lower subscapular also supplies 
	- Thoracodorsal nerve (C6-8, posterior cord)
	- Medial antebrachial cutaneous, medial brachial cutaneous, medial pectoral nerve (C8/T1, medial cord)
- Others
	- Suprascapular nerve
		- Goes through the suprascapular foramen while the suprascapular artery goes over it
	- Intercostal brachial nerve (T2) - cutaneous in axilla
	- Nerve to subclavius
### Dermatomes
- Area of skin innervated by *one* spinal segment
- Segmental pattern from embryology
- Variation and overlap
![[Pasted image 20260215220958.png]]
### Skin Supply (Named cutaneous nerves)
- These are named cutaneous nerves
	- e.g. radial/median/ulnar cutaneous branches
	- Named nerves contain afferent neurones from more than 1 spinal level
![[Pasted image 20260215221423.png]]
### Myotomes
- A group of muscles innervated by a single spinal segment
	- Usually with a common action
- Named nerves will contain efferent neurones from multiple spinal levels
	- Can be used for testing nerve roots

> [!info] Analogy
> - **Dermatome = “postcode”** (one spinal level’s territory)
>- **Named nerve = “delivery van route”** (mixes postcodes)
>- **Myotome = “what the postcode makes you able to do”** (movement test)

### Compartments
- Muscles in each compartment have the same (named) nerve supply
### Overview
- Musculocutaneous
	- Arm, Anterior Compartment muscles
	- *Lateral Cutaneous nerve of the forearm*
- Median
	- Forearm, Anterior compartment muscles
	- Hand, thenar muscles +
	- *1/2 skin of palm*
- Ulnar
	- Forearm, 1 1/2 muscles
	- Hand, small muscle
	- *1/2 skin of hand.*
- Radial
	- Arm, Posterior Compartment muscles
	- *Forearm, posterolateral skin*
	- *Hand, dorsal skin*
- Axillary
	- Deltoid and Teres Minor Muscles
	- *Skin of supra-lateral arm*

Motor
*Sensory*

### Injuries
- Obstetric vs Traumatic
	- Obstetric
		- Being birthed, pulling on head -> tension on neck/shoulder
	- Traumatic
		- e.g. landing on the side of your head
#### Erb's Palsy
- Upper brachial plexus injury
	- Roots C5,6
		- Changes in sensation
	- Waiters Tip
		- Inability to laterally rotate shoulder, unable to flex elbow, inability to supinate forearm
	- Type of brachial plexus birth injury causing arm weakness or paralysis, usually resulting from traumatic stretching of the infant's shoulder/neck nerves (C5-C6) during difficult delivery.
#### Klumpke's palsy
- Lower brachial plexus injury
	- Roots C8, T1
		- Changes in sensation
		- Weakness or paralysis in forearm, wrist and hand
	- Claw hand - intrinsic hand muscles - metacarpalphalangeal joint is extended, interphalangeal joint is flexed
	- When being birthed, yanking arm "up"
