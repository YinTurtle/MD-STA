- Describe the energy sources available to skeletal muscle and the role of ATP in contraction
- Describe events during cross bridge formation to generate sarcomere shortening
- Compare and contrast the key physiological and biochemical properties of skeletal muscle fast and slow fibre types
- Define the length-tension relationship and load-velocity relationship of muscle contraction

### [[Sarcomere Structure]] Recap
- Sarcomeres: highly organised, functional units of skeletal and cardiac muscle - striated appearance.
Contractile proteins:
- **Actin** (thin filaments)
- **Myosin** (thick filaments)
- **Z discs** define boundary of each sarcomere - thousands of sarcomeres can make up a single muscle myofibre
- **I band (isotropic)** - mainly actin filament
- **A band (anisotropic)** - mainly myosin and overlapping actin filaments

#### Sliding Filament Theory - Sarcomere Shortening

### Role of ATP in Muscle
#### Membrane Potential
Na+ /K+ -ATPase in sarcolemma maintains Na+ and K+ gradients, allowing production and propagation of action potentials.
#### Ca2+ Gradient
Active transport of calcium ions into the sarcoplasmic reticulum - lowering [Ca2+] i
Used by [[Excitation Contraction Coupling in Cardiac and Skeletal Muscle#SERCA]]
#### Power Stroke
Hydrolysis of ATP by myosin-ATPase energises the cross-bridge formation enabling sarcomere shortening & contraction
#### Cross Bridge Dissociation
Binding of ATP to myosin dissociates cross-bridges bound to actin
### Energy Supply for Contraction
Muscles contain ~4mM of ATP - only enough for ~2 seconds contraction
- Muscles don't have enough ATP for long contractions
- So during rest, ATP phosphorylates creatine to create creatine phosphate (CP)
	- Creatine phosphate is stored in sarcoplasm
	- Has phosphate group attached, which it can donate to the ADP to create ATP, which is energy used for muscle contraction.
	- Enough energy for ~8 seconds contraction

### Skeletal Muscle Energy Metabolism
#### Creatine phosphate
Rapid ATP formation at the onset of muscle contraction. Used in short term.
#### Glycolysis
Anaerobic (fast rate of ATP generation from glucose/glycogen for ~1 minute). This is useful for generating small amounts of ATP but very quickly. Doesn't require oxygen. This builds up lactic acid.
#### Oxidative phosphorylation
Most efficient way of generating ATP. Aerobic (supplies most amount of ATP per glucose molecule and powers contraction for hours). Happens within mitochondria. Cardiac muscles relies heavily on oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria for over 95% of its ATP production to meet high energy demands.

### Cross Bridge Formation & the Power Stroke
This process happens so quickly, it is a continuing process. Regulation of cross bridge formation is due to availability of myosin binding sites on actin. via [Ca2+]i and tropomyosin.

**Step 1** - ATP bind to myosin head to release it from the actin.
When binding to myosin head, it causes a *confirmation change* in the myosin head, "cocks" it and move it away from the actin.
**Step 2** - ATP hydrolysis. This causes more confirmation change in myosin head to be ready to bind with actin again.
**Step 3** - A weak cross-bridge forms as myosin head binds to the actin. Weak interactions at this point. 
**Step 4** - Phosphate bond is removed from myosin
**Step 5** - Energy is also being released, which powered the power stroke. Power stroke moves the actin filament, causing shortening of the sarcomere
**Step 6** - ADP is also released at the end.
![[Pasted image 20260211163856.png]]
Remember not all active sites of the actin is going to bind with myosin. Greater stimulation = greater number of interactions.

### Rigor Mortis
- Refers to the muscular stiffness that occurs after death - post-mortem rigidity.
- Can begin ~2 hours after death, peaks at ~12 hours and lasts ~36 hours
#### Reason
1. Death
2. Loss of muscle cell integrity
3. Calcium leaks into the cytosol from SR, some level of cross-bridge with remaining ATP
4. Calcium binds to troponin
5. Myosin binds to actin
6. Metabolism and ATP production ceases
7. No ATP present to break cross-bridges
8. Muscles become stiff
9. Proteolytic enzymes work within a few days

### Muscle Fibre Types
Different muscle fibre types depend on function.
#### Type 1 - slow oxidative fibres
- Slow- twitch fibres
- Oxidative (aerobic)
- High in myoglobin - lots of oxygen
- *Combine slow myosin-ATPase activity, high oxidative capacity*
#### Type 11A - fast oxidative glycolytic fibres
- Fast-twitch fibres
- *Combined fast myosin-ATPase activity with high oxidative capacity and intermediate glycolytic capacity*
#### Type 11B/ (11X in human) - fast glycolytic fibres
- Very fast-twitch fibres
- *Combine fast myosin-ATPase activity with high glycolytic capacity*
- Low in myoglobin and oxygen
![[Pasted image 20260211165942.png]]

#### Fibre Type Differences
- Skeletal muscle fibres are classified based on mechanical and metabolic characteristics:
	- *Maximal velocities* of contractions (fast or slow) - how fast is the contraction
	- *Major pathway* for generation of *ATP* (oxidative or glycolytic) - how fast they hydrolyse ATP
- Different muscle types have different isotypes of myosin ATPases
	- Different maximal rates of cross bridge cycling
- Fibre types have differing physiological features:
	- Greater in slow oxidative fibres
		- Number of *mitochondria*
		- Amount of *myoglobin*
		- *Blood vessels/capillaries*
	- Greater in fast glycolytic fibres
		- Stores of *glycogen/glycolytic enzymes/creatine phosphate*
		- *Size *of fibre type
		- Highest *power* output
![[Pasted image 20260211170712.png]]
Can't change composition of fibre types, nor the number - cannot be replaced.

### Contraction Velocity
- Each myofibre/muscle cell has its own neuromuscular junction
- Duration of contraction differs depending on *myosin fibre type* composition of individual muscles
- Highly adapted to function:
	- Ocular - extremely rapid speed of force of contraction
	- Gastrocnemius - moderately rapid
	- Soleus - relatively slow

### Summary of Muscle Fibre Characteristics
![[Pasted image 20260211171922.png|900]]
Basically why a fast-glycolytic fibre is a fast muscle is because the fibres have a *high myosin ATPase* which allows the fibres to *quickly hydrolyse* the ATP for quick [[Sarcomere Structure#Cross Bridge Formation and Power Stroke|cross-bridge]] cycling.
Slow-oxidative fibres are slow because they have low-activity form of myosin ATPase, which breaks down ATP at a slower rate, unlike fast-glycolytic fibres.

### Force Generation
- A single motor neurone innervates multiple muscle fibres
- All fibres innervated by a single neurone are called a motor unit
- Generally – small muscles with fine control have fewer muscle fibres per neurone e.g. laryngeal muscles
- Conversely large muscles may have hundreds of fibres in a motor unit e.g. soleus
![[Pasted image 20260211172826.png]]

#### Motor Unit Recruitment - size principle
- Force of contraction depends on:
	- Number of motor units recruited
	- Frequency of action potentials
- Motor units recruited in a progressive way, from small (weakest) to large (strongest)
##### Small motor unit
(innervating the fewest number of muscle fibres)
- more excitable
- conduct action potentials more slowly
- typically type 1 (slow) fibres
##### Large motor unit
- less excitable
- conduct action potentials more rapidly
- typically type 11 (fast) fibres
![[Pasted image 20260211173105.png]]
Rm = membrane resistance; Isyn = synaptic current

- Strength of muscle contractions vary depending on demands placed on them
- As greater force is required, more motor units are recruited, following the size principle
- Force exerted by a contracting muscle is known as muscle tension
- Force exerted by an object to be moved is called the load
- Muscle has to overcome the load force in order to shorten
![[Pasted image 20260211173328.png]]
>[!info]  Just some info, not necessary for now
>**More motor units are recruited when the CNS increases drive because sensory feedback (and movement error) indicates the current force is insufficient.** Not the muscle “deciding,” but a control loop reacting to load and performance.
>
>You can train small motor units to produce **more force than they used to**, but you can’t train them to **replace** large motor units for very heavy loads; heavy loads still require high-threshold recruitment.

### Isotonic V.S. Isometric Contraction
#### Isotonic Contraction
Muscle shortening will occur if peak tension is greater than the load force.
#### Isometric Contraction
Muscle stimulation will increase tension, but no shortening will occur if load force is greater than muscle peak force.

### Summation of Muscle Fibres
A. One AP leads to a single skeletal muscle twitch (25-200 msec)
B. As muscle twitch far exceeds duration of AP, it is possible to initiate a second AP before 1st contraction has subsided. The 2nd twitch is stronger than the first due to higher calcium left in cytosol - *summation*
C. Multiple AP occurring close together - frequency summation - there is still muscle relaxation between each twitch
D. Tetanus - stimulation frequency so high that individual contractions fuse, and there is no time for muscle relaxation
![[Pasted image 20260211174801.png|700]]

### Length-Tension Relationship
Length-tension is directly related to overlap between actin and myosin within the sarcomere.
- (c) Maximum tension possible - comes from optimal overlap and cross bridge formation.
	- Most myosin heads can bind actin, so maximum cross-bridge formation
This can be maintained until actin begins to abut (border with) the M line.
- (b) Reducing tension due to interference of sarcomere components
	- Actin filaments from opposite sides start to get too close, and actin begins to *abut the M line (the centre)*
	- "Interference" happen as components crowd each other.
Or
- (d) Fewer cross bridges possible due to stretching.
	- Overlap between actin and myosin decreases, so fewer myosin heads can reach actin.
Near-zero tension
- (a) Zero tension as too much overlap/interference of components
Or
- (e) No actin/myosin to overlap
	- No cross-bridges, so there is zero active tension

**Concentric contraction** = muscle shortens while producing force (left side of graph)
**Eccentric contraction** = muscle lengthens while producing force (right side of graph)

### Load (Tension)-Velocity Relationship
- Full muscle contraction is rapid, with no load (~100 ms)
- The greater the load weight, the slower the velocity of contraction.
