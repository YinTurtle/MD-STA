### LO
- Describe the organisation and roles of the main proteins located within the sarcomere
- Explain the interaction of myosin and actin in sarcomere shortening
- Explain the role of regulatory proteins troponin and tropomyosin
- Describe the role of calcium in initiating muscle contraction
- Briefly describe events occurring at the neuromuscular junction

### Contraction Overview Pathway
- Neuronal stimulus arrives at the muscle (motor neurone).
- Signal transfers to the muscle cell membrane (sarcolemma) at the neuromuscular junction.
- The electrical signal is relayed deep into the muscle fibre via T-tubules.
- This triggers Ca²⁺ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR).
- Ca²⁺ allows actin and myosin to interact → sarcomeres shorten → contraction.

### Muscle Fibre Parts
- **Sarcolemma**: the muscle cell membrane.
- **Sarcoplasm**: cytoplasm.
- **Sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)**: specialised smooth ER that stores Ca²⁺.
- **Myofibre**: skeletal muscle cell/myocyte.
    - **Myofibrils**: lots of sarcomeres end to end. Myofibrils are bundled together to form myofibres
    - **Myofilament**: actin or myosin


### Muscle Development
![[Pasted image 20260205014101.png]]
- Mesoderm cells -> myoblasts -> myotube -> mature skeletal muscle fiber
    - Satellite cells - stem cells that lie on the outside of the fiber, can fuse into the fiber to repair the cells (think damage or exercise) or to contribute more nuclei and therefore more energy (metabolism for exercise)

### T-tubules
(Transverse 'T'-tubules)
- T-tubules are **extensions of the sarcolemma** that invaginate into the fibre.
- Their job is to **carry the action potential deep into the cell**, so the whole fibre can respond together.
- They are closely associated with the SR (to stimulate release of Ca2+), forming a “triad” arrangement in skeletal muscle (T-tubule flanked by SR terminal cisternae in the diagram)
- Usually placed between A and I bands of myofibril (repeating, striated patterns of actin (thin) and myosin (thick) filaments)

### Sarcoplasmic Reticulum
- Smooth endoplasmic reticulum that surrounds each individual myofibrils
- Stores calcium and releases it on stimulation -> contraction
![[Pasted image 20260205014707.png|300]]

### Sarcomere
- Sarcomeres are the **functional units** of myofibrils.
- **Z-discs** form the boundaries of each sarcomere.
- **Actin** = thin filaments, **myosin** = thick filaments.

![[Pasted image 20260205015010.png|400]]
- **I band**: region with thin filaments only (actin only); spans either side of Z disc.
- **A band**: length of thick filaments (myosin). This includes the overlap region where actin and myosin overlap.
- **H zone**: central part of A band where only myosin is present (no actin overlap).
- **M line**: middle line of the sarcomere (centre of the H zone), where thick filaments are linked/anchored.
- **Z disc**: boundary line between sarcomeres; anchors thin filaments.

### Contractile Proteins
##### Myosin
- Thick filament is formed from **bipolar assemblies** of myosin-II.
- Each myosin-II molecule has:
	- **Two heavy chains** (form the tail and head).
	- **Two essential light chains (MLC-1)**: stabilise the myosin head.
	- **Two regulatory light chains (MLC-2)**: regulate myosin ATPase activity.
- Only has heads in area of overlap with actin - nothing near the M line
- The myosin head is the “motor.” Its ATPase activity is what turns chemical energy (ATP) into movement (the power stroke). The light chains modulate how that motor behaves.

##### Actin
- Actin forms the thin filament and is shown as intertwined chains
- Actin provides the binding track for myosin heads. The key is that myosin binding sites on actin are not always accessible—this is what regulation controls.

### Regulatory Proteins
##### Tropomyosin
Prevents myosin binding to actin (in relaxed state)
##### Troponin
Binds actin, tropomyosin and calcium
- TnC – binds Ca2+
- TnT – binds tropomyosin
- TnI – binds actin (inhibits contraction)
![[Pasted image 20260205015643.png|500]]
At rest, tropomyosin sits over actin’s “docking sites.” When Ca²⁺ binds TnC, [[Sarcomere Structure#Troponin]] changes shape and moves [[Sarcomere Structure#Tropomyosin]] out of the way. That exposes actin binding sites so myosin can attach.

### Additional Info
- **α-actinin**: anchors actin at the Z disc, helping define sarcomere boundaries.
- **Titin**: provides elastic “spring-like” support connecting thick filaments toward the Z disc, helping the sarcomere recoil and keeping thick filaments centred.
- **Nebulin**: helps stabilise thin filaments and contributes to defining thin filament length.
- **Dystrophin**: links internal cytoskeleton to the cell membrane support system, helping transmit force and protect the fibre during contraction.

### Role of Calcium
- After neuronal stimulation and muscle depolarisation, **Ca²⁺ is released from SR** and binds **TnC**.
- This causes conformational changes in troponin (TnI and TnT) and **rotates tropomyosin** to reveal myosin binding sites on actin.
- With ATP available, myosin binds actin → [[Sarcomere Structure#Sarcomere]] shorten → muscle contracts.
- Calcium couples the electrical stimulation into mechanical contraction – Excitation-Contraction Coupling
![[Pasted image 20260205020211.png|400]]

### Sarcomere Shortening
- Myosin binds actin and pulls inward, so **Z discs move closer together**.
- **I band reduces in size**.
- **A band remains the same width**, because thick filament length doesn’t change; overlap increases.
- Filaments do not shorten. Instead, they slide past each other. Increased overlap compresses the “actin-only” region (I band) and shrinks the “myosin-only” centre (H zone).

### Cross Bridge Formation and Power Stroke
##### The Cycle:
1. **Exposure of binding sites:** Ca²⁺ shifts tropomyosin so myosin can bind actin.
2. **Cross-bridge formation:** myosin head attaches to actin.
3. **Power stroke:** myosin head pivots, pulling actin inward; ADP/Pi are released during/after force generation (as depicted).
4. **Detachment:** ATP binding allows myosin to detach from actin. (Without ATP, detachment cannot occur.)
5. **Re-cocking:** ATP hydrolysis re-energises (“cocks”) the myosin head to bind again.

##### Neuromuscular Junction
- Action potential travels down motor neurone to terminal bouton.
- Voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels open; Ca²⁺ influx causes vesicles containing acetylcholine (ACh) to fuse and release ACh into synaptic cleft.
- ACh binds **nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChR)** on the muscle end plate.
- **Acetylcholinesterase** rapidly breaks down ACh in the cleft.
- ACh binding opens ligand-gated channels at the end plate, which triggers a local depolarisation (end-plate potential). If sufficient, this triggers a muscle action potential that travels along sarcolemma and down T-tubules to initiate SR Ca²⁺ release.

[Voltage gated calcium channels open -> Ca enters -> vesicles containing Ach fuse w/ membrane, released into the synaptic cleft, attaches to Nicotinic Ach receptors (nAchR) -> action potential is generated -> Acetylcholinesterase rapidly breaks Ach down in synaptic cleft]
![[Pasted image 20260205020759.png|400]]

##### End of Contraction
- When action potentials stop, **Ca²⁺ is pumped back into SR** by **SERCA** (sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺ ATPase).
- Inside SR, **calsequestrin and calreticulin** bind Ca²⁺ (major Ca-binding proteins in skeletal muscle), helping store high Ca²⁺ in SR without raising free SR Ca²⁺ excessively.
- These are located predominantly at the **triad junction** region.
- Calcium may also be transported extracellularly via symporters (cardiac and smooth muscle).

[Relaxation happens because cytosolic Ca²⁺ falls, Ca²⁺ dissociates from troponin, tropomyosin re-covers binding sites, and cross-bridge cycling stops.]

##### Relay Pathway
AP arrives at motor terminal → ACh release → binds receptors → sarcolemma depolarises → action potential spreads along sarcolemma → down T-tubules → SR releases Ca²⁺ → Ca²⁺ binds troponin → actin sites exposed → myosin binds → contraction begins.
![[Pasted image 20260205021028.png]]

### Summary
During contraction
- Z discs: move closer
- Sarcomere length: decreases
- I band: decreases
- H zone: decreases
- A band: stays the same

[A motor neurone action potential triggers ACh release at the neuromuscular junction; ACh binds nicotinic receptors on the sarcolemma and initiates a muscle action potential. The action potential travels along the sarcolemma and into the fibre via T-tubules, which are closely associated with the SR. This triggers SR Ca²⁺ release; Ca²⁺ binds troponin C, shifting troponin-tropomyosin and exposing myosin-binding sites on actin. Myosin binds actin and, using ATP, cycles through cross-bridge formation and power strokes, pulling actin inward so Z discs move closer. Relaxation occurs when Ca²⁺ is pumped back into the SR by SERCA and binding sites are re-covered.]
