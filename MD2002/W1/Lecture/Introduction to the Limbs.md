### LO
- Briefly explain the development of the limbs
- Explain the significance of medial rotation of the lower limb during the development
- Compare and contrast the upper and lower limb functions
- Define the terms related to the muscles
- Describe briefly the differences between types of muscle contraction
- Describe the fascia and muscular compartments of both limbs
- Describe the movements available in the joints of both limbs
- Describe an overview of the neurovascular supply of both limbs

##### Bipedal
> Using two limbs as locomotion

### Development of the Limbs
- Limb buds appear **week 4** from the **ventrolateral body wall**.
- They contain cells from:
	- **Somites** (classically → muscles/segmental pattern)
    - **Lateral plate mesoderm** (classically → skeletal/connective components)  
- Segmental levels:
    - **Upper limb bud** opposite **C5–T1 somites**
    - **Lower limb bud** opposite **L2–S2 somites**, appearing about **~2 days later**

### Limb Rotation
Starting position (early embryo)
- Thumb and hallux are initially on the **cranial/superior side** of each limb.
- Palm and sole initially face **anteriorly** (or medially in some diagrams).
##### Upper limb rotates **laterally**

Results:
- Thumb moves **superior → lateral**
- **Flexor** muscle groups move to **anterior**
- **Extensors** move to **posterior**
##### Lower limb rotates **medially**

Results:
- Hallux moves **superior → medial**
- **Flexor** muscle groups move **anterior → posterior**
- **Extensors** move to **anterior**
- **Dermatomes rotate too**

##### Clinical questions
1. Why are dermatomes neat on the trunk but messy in limbs? (rotation + growth changes the layout)
2. Why is thumb lateral but big toe medial? (opposite directions of rotation)
3. Why are upper limb flexors anterior but lower limb flexors posterior? (lower limb flexor mass shifts posterior with medial rotation)

### Muscles - overview
- 3 types: skeletal muscles, smooth muscles, cardiac muscles
- Origin is usually the proximal end of the muscle, which remains fixed during muscular contraction
- Insertion is usually the distal end of the muscle, which is movable
- When stimulated, a muscle contracts and tries to bring its two ends closer
- When muscles contract and shorten, they usually shorten 

### Muscle Contraction

##### Isometric contraction
> Muscle tone changes (muscle length does not change, but feels tense)
> e.g. holding a bag still

##### Isotonic contraction
> Muscle length changes (concentric and eccentric)
###### Concentric
> Muscle shortens while contracting
###### Eccentric
> Muscle lengthens while under tension (to prevent damage)
> e.g. when going down the stairs, quadriceps contract eccentrically to prevent the knees from collapsing

### Muscle terminology
###### Prime mover
Muscle(s) that play the primary role in moving a body part.
###### Agonist
Muscle(s) that acts directly to produce a desired movement.
###### Synergist
Muscle(s) which assist the prime mover but are doing less of the work or prevent unwanted movements associated with the action of the [[Introduction to the Limbs#Prime mover|prime mover]].
###### Antagonist
Muscle(s) which directly oppose a movement.
###### Fixator
Muscle(s) that provide the necessary support to assist in holding the rest of the body in place while the movement occurs.

### Fascia
##### Superficial fascia
- Just beneath the skin
- Contains adipose tissue
##### Deep (investing) fascia
- Sometimes named
- Ensheaths muscles but continuous
- Facilitate contraction
- Barrier between muscles
- Compartments of muscles
- Passages for nerves and vessels
- Attachment for muscles (e.g. by forming interosseous membranes)
- Hold tendons in place (by forming Retinaculae)

<The top is the superficial fascia, bottom is deep (investing) fascia>

###### Deep fascia
- Deep fascia sends septae (intermuscular septa) between the muscles to separate them into compartments
- Septae also form potential spaces to allow passage of nerves and blood vessels
- Potential spaces are also potential tracks for infection spread and blood loss

### Compartment syndrome
An injury to the muscle within a tough compartment may cause swelling and increased pressure that compresses the neurovascular bundles

### Deep fascia of the Limbs

##### Arm
- Medial and lateral intramuscular septae separate
- Anterior compartment - flexor
- Posterior compartment - extensor
- All surrounded by the brachial fascia

##### Forearm
- Antebrachial fascia surrounds and separates:
- Anterior compartment - flexor/pronator
- Posterior compartment - extensor/supinator
- And forms an interosseous membrane
- At the wrist it thickens to form a flexor retinaculum - the carpal tunnel

![[Pasted image 20260130134822.png]]

##### Thigh
- Thicker than Upper limb
- Thigh - fascia lata
- Thickened laterally to form: iliotibial tract

- Septae form 3 compartments
	- Anterior - extensor
	- Medial - adductor
	- Posterior - flexor

##### Leg
- Crural fascia
- Fuses with tibia
- Forms interosseous membrane
- Send septae to form:
	- Anterior - extensor
	- Lateral - everters
	- Posterior - flexor and plantar flexor
		- Deep and Superficial

### Control muscles - neurones
- Excitable nerve cells which transmit information as electric signals or "action potentials"
- A typical neuron has a cell body (soma) and neurite(s). Neurite is either a dendrite or an axon
- A neuron can be motor or sensory
- Motor neurons can be somatic or autonomic

###### Axon
A single neurite, can be longer than 1m, covered with myelin or Schwann sheath
###### Dendrites
Are multiple, thin, short extensions of a neurite

### Spinal Nerve
![[Pasted image 20260130141642.png]]

### Dermatomes vs Myotome

###### Dermatome
Area of skin supplied by neurones from **one spinal segment**.

###### Myotome
Muscle or group of muscles supplied by neurones from **one spinal segment**, usually sharing the same action.

### Plexus
- To go from segmental spinal nerves to named limb nerves, you need a **plexus**.
- Upper limb: Brachial plexus (C5–T1), formed in the **axilla**.
- Lower limb: Lumbosacral plexus (L1–S5) (limb mainly **L2–S2**), a major feature of the **posterior abdominal wall**, supplying abdominal wall, pelvis, and viscera too

### Blood supply
- Upper limb arterial supply: from **subclavian artery.** 
- Lower limb arterial supply: mainly **external iliac artery** (plus some internal iliac contribution).

### Venous drainage
- Two systems:
	- **Superficial veins**: in superficial fascia, individually named; used for venepuncture.
    - **Deep veins**: accompany arteries, often as **venae comitantes**, take the artery’s name.
	    - e.g. Venae comitantes of X artery
- Flow usually **superficial → deep** via perforating veins.
- **Valves** prevent backflow.

##### Lower limb extra: getting blood uphill 
Venous return against gravity is helped by:
- Muscle pump
- Arterial pulsation
- Negative intrathoracic pressure
- Venous valves

### Lymphatics
- Lymph tends to follow **deep and superficial veins**.
- Important for spread of **infection** or **metastases**.
- Main node groups:
    - Upper limb → axillary nodes
    - Lower limb → inguinal nodes

### Movement and Myotomes
- Thumb movement
    - Across the palm and back - flexion and extension
    - Side to side along the coronal plane of the thumb
- Hilton's law - "Any nerve that moves a muscle connected to a joint, also serve the skin nerves over those muscles and inside of that joint"

Every muscle: >= two attachments
