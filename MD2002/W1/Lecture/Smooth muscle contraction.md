### Smooth Muscle Recap
Found in:
- Blood vessels: regulates lumen diameter – contributes to maintenance of blood pressure
- Digestive tract: rhythmic peristalsis propels food
- Bladder wall / urinary tracts
- Respiratory tract
- Reproductive tract
- Eyes
- Skin

### Smooth Muscle Cells
- Small – 30-200 µm in length
- Spindle shaped cells arranged into sheets
- Less regularly organised
- No striations
- Single nucleus
- Involuntary – ANS, hormones & stretch

### Types of Smooth Muscle

##### Multi-unit smooth muscle
- Mainly innervated by nerve signals
- Separate fibres in each with their own nerve ending - therefore they have their own independent contraction
- e.g. ciliary muscle of the eye; iris; piloerector muscles; vas deferens
##### Unitary (or single-unit) smooth muscle
- Connected by gap junctions
- Sheets of electrically coupled cells - syncytium (a single cell or cytoplasmic mass containing several, formed by fusion of cells or by division of nuclei) or visceral smooth muscle
- Contract in unison
- e.g. GI tract, bile ducts, ureters, uterus & blood vessels

### Smooth Muscle Structure
- No striations: actin and myosin filaments arranged diagonally along fibres – less regularly organised
- Dense bodies correspond to Z discs – lattice-like structures anchoring actin within the fibre and tethers contractile proteins to the sarcolemma
- Dense bodies: composed of intermediate filaments (α- actinin/desmin/vimentin) – transmit force of contraction within and between cells

![[Pasted image 20260129151611.png]]

- **Gap junctions** electrically couple cells in unitary smooth muscle
- **Focal adhesions** connect cells together mechanically
- **No troponin** - regulation of smooth muscle contraction differs to both skeletal and cardiac muscle
- **No T tubules** (transverse tubules)
- The sarcoplasmic reticulum is much less developed

![[Pasted image 20260129151825.png]]

### Sarcoplasmic Reticulum & Caveolae
- **Sarcoplasmic reticulum** - largely associated with the sarcolemma and not clearly aligned with myofilaments
- Ca2+ is released from SR, however not the main source for contraction
![[Pasted image 20260129160055.png]]

- **Caveolae** - pouchlike infolding of the sarcolemma - contain large numbers of Ca2+ channels
- **Extracellular Ca2+** is the main trigger for contraction (different from skeletal muscle)
![[Pasted image 20260129160220.png]]

### Excitation Contraction Coupling
- Following stimulation, influx of Ca2+ couples the excitation into mechanical contraction
- Two sources of Ca2+ contribute to this:
	- Extracellular Ca2+ influx
	- Sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)
- Mechanisms leading to increases in [Ca2+]i
	- **Voltage gated L type Ca2+ channels** leading to calcium induced calcium release (CICR) via RyR activation
	- **Receptor operated Ca2+ channels** leading to IP3 receptor activation CICR
![[Pasted image 20260129171539.png]]

### Smooth Muscle Actin & Myosin
- **Myosin:** tertiary structure similar to skeletal/cardiac, however some differences:
- Amino acid sequence
- Arrangement of myosin heads
	- Along the entire length of molecule
	- Head hinges opposing direction on the same filament - pulls in opposite directions, increasing shortening
- **Smooth Muscle Actin:**
	- α-SMA – vascular
	- γ-SMA – GI tract
	- No troponin
- **Calmodulin:** Key regulatory protein enabling myosin to interact with actin
![[Pasted image 20260129172216.png]]

### Myosin Activation
###### Activation of Myosin
- Phosphorylation of myosin needed for cross bridge formation with actin
- Via calmodulin/myosin light chain kinase (MLCK)

###### Relaxation
- Myosin must be dephosphorylated for relaxation to occur - while phosphorylated, it will continue to form cross bridges with actin
![[Pasted image 20260129172505.png]]

### Smooth Muscle Contraction
1. Initiated by **calcium influx** from extracellular fluid and SR
2. Calcium binds to **calmodulin** (instead of troponin as in skeletal muscle)
3. **Ca-calmodulin-MLCK** complex leads to phosphorylation of MLC (requires ATP)
4. **Phosphorylated myosin** head binds to actin and **power stroke** occurs automatically

![[Pasted image 20260129152847.png]]

CaM = Calmodulin
MLC = Myosin light chain
MLCK = Myosin light chain kinase

> [!info] Contraction
> Ca²⁺ rises (influx +/or SR release) → Ca²⁺–calmodulin activates **MLCK** → MLCK phosphorylates myosin light chain → ↑ myosin ATPase → myosin binds actin and cycles → contraction.

### Smooth Muscle Relaxation
5. When stimulus ends, **calcium is pumped out** of the cell or into the SR
6. When calcium drops below a **critical** level, calcium dissociates from calmodulin (**inactivates MLCK**)
7. **Myosin light chain phosphatase** removes phosphate from the MLC, causing detachment of the myosin head from the actin filament, causing relaxation

> [!info] Relaxation
> Ca²⁺ is removed (SERCA into SR + extrusion) → Ca²⁺ falls, calmodulin disengages → **MLCK inactivates** and **MLCP dephosphorylates myosin** → cross-bridge cycling and force fall → relaxation.

The timing of relaxation is determined by amount of active myosin phosphatase in cells.

### Calcium Homeostasis (to clear)
- Calcium is transported out of the sarcoplasm – into extracellular fluid or into the SR via:
	- Membrane Ca2+ ATPase > Active
		- This pump sits in the cell membrane.
		- It uses ATP to push Ca²⁺ out of the cell into the extracellular fluid.
		- Active because it moves Ca²⁺ against its gradient
	- Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) > Active
		- This pump sits on the SR membrane
		- Uses ATP to pump Ca2+ from cytosol back into SR
	- Na+ - Ca2+ exchangers > Passive (doesn't use ATP)
		- Technically its secondary active. The process of Na+ entering the cell pushes Ca2+ out of the cell. 
- Mechanisms in place to ensure sufficient calcium returned to the SR:
	- Stim1 senses calcium levels in SR and activates store-operated Ca2+ channels (SOCs) for influx of calcium back into the cell
- Enables SR to refill
- Occurs at specialized regions where SR encounters the sarcolemma

### Neuronal Stimulation
- Smooth muscle lacks highly specialised neuromuscular junctions (as seen with skeletal muscle)
- Autonomic nerve fibres branch diffusely creating synaptic clefts:
	- **Unitary muscle** (top image) have wide diffuse junctions
	- **Multi-unit muscle** cell junctions are closer in proximity – contact junctions
![[Pasted image 20260129174216.png]]
- Swellings called varicosities release neurotransmitter in the general area of smooth muscle cells
- Unlike skeletal muscle, smooth muscle cell membranes contain receptors which can initiate or inhibit contraction

### Autonomic Nervous System
- Varicosities originate from postganglionic fibers of both **sympathetic** and **parasympathetic** neurons
- Varicosities from a single axon may be located along several muscle cells
- Several smooth muscle cells are influenced by neurotransmitters released by a single neuron, and a single smooth muscle cell may be influenced by neurotransmitters from more than one neuron
- Neurotransmitter can be **acetylcholine** (ACh) or **noradrenalin** (occasionally others) – NOT released from the same neuron

### Neurotransmitters
- The type of response (excitatory or inhibitory) depends on the receptors the chemical messenger binds to, not the chemical messenger in the target cell membrane.
- Neurotransmitters can either stimulate or inhibit contractile activity
- A neurotransmitter may produce opposite effects in different smooth muscle tissues:
	- Noradrenaline stimulates contraction of most vascular smooth muscle by acting on α-adrenergic receptors but produces relaxation of airway (bronchiolar) smooth muscle by acting on β2-adrenergic receptors
- Type of response (excitatory or inhibitory) depends not on the chemical messenger per se, but on the receptors the chemical messenger binds to in the target cell membrane

### Regulators of Smooth Muscle Contraction
In addition to ANS stimulation, smooth muscle contraction can be initiated by other factors:
- Spontaneous electrical activity
- Stretch
- Hormones
- Local chemicals within the extracellular fluid:
	- Oxygen
	- Carbon Dioxide
	- pH
	- Ion concentration
	- Nitric oxide
- Allows fine tuning of activity in response to environment
![[Pasted image 20260129174731.png]]
### Membrane & Action Potentials
- Different smooth muscle organs may have different mechanism in action potentials. The red and yellow is more common, however the GI tract may look like the blue graph.
![[Pasted image 20260129154430.png]]
- Smooth muscle resting membrane potential is -50 to -60 mV
- Unitary smooth muscle spike potentials can be generated by:
	- Electrical stimulation
	- Hormones
	- Stretch
	- Spontaneous depolarisation from pace maker cells (interstitial cells) of the intestinal wall
- Plateau – similar to those in cardiac tissue
- Calcium mainly responsible for membrane potential in smooth muscle – slower to open and close than Na+ channels

### Latch Mechanism & Smooth Muscle Tone
- Smooth muscle contraction is prolonged – lasting minutes, hours or even days (tonic contraction)
- Due to slower ATPase activity / cross bridge formation and slower response to influx of Ca2+ ions (in comparison with skeletal & cardiac muscle)
- Force of contraction is often greater than that of skeletal muscle – due to the longer cross bridge attachments between actin & myosin
- The **latch mechanism** maintains prolonged contraction, with minimal ATP use – only 1 ATP required for each cycle
- Occurs when myosin dephosphorylated while still attached to actin (only if [Ca2+] i remains elevated above background levels)

![[Pasted image 20260129154556.png]]
Smooth muscle contracts when cytosolic Ca²⁺ rises and turns on myosin (via calmodulin + MLCK), and relaxes when Ca²⁺ falls and myosin is dephosphorylated (via myosin phosphatase).
