### LO
- Classify muscles according to their different physiological function - skeletal, cardiac and smooth
- Describe the structural hierarchy of skeletal muscles
- Compare and contrast the major histological features of skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscle

### What muscles do in the body (functional roles)
Muscle is used for far more than “movement”:
- **Body movement:** skeletal muscle contraction moves joints.
- **Posture:** continual low-level skeletal muscle activity maintains posture.
- **Support/protection:** skeletal muscles support joints and protect viscera (e.g., abdominal wall).
- **Sphincter control:** skeletal and smooth muscle contribute to sphincters (e.g., bladder, anus; cardiac sphincter in stomach).
- **Movement of food:** smooth muscle generates peristalsis along the GI tract.
- **Blood flow regulation:** cardiac muscle pumps blood; smooth muscle in vessel walls regulates lumen diameter and distribution.
- **Temperature regulation:** skeletal muscle shivering generates heat; smooth muscle erects hairs.

### Properties all muscle types share (core definitions)
All muscle tissue has four key functional properties:
- **Excitability:** responds to a stimulus (e.g., neurotransmitter/chemical signal).
- **Contractility:** can shorten forcibly when stimulated.
- **Extensibility:** can stretch beyond resting length.
- **Elasticity:** recoils back toward resting length after stretching.

Common biochemical/physiological features:
- **Actin and myosin** generate force (these are the main contractile proteins).
- **ATP** is required (from aerobic oxidative respiration and, for skeletal muscle, anaerobic glycolysis as well).
- **Calcium ions** are needed to activate contraction.
- **Stimulation** commonly involves an action potential (skeletal via motor neurones; cardiac and smooth also have other inputs).

### Muscle cell
Muscle cells use specialised terms for standard cell components:
- **Sarcolemma** = cell membrane.
- **Sarcoplasm** = cytoplasm.
- **Sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)** = specialised endoplasmic reticulum that stores Ca²⁺.
- Muscle cells have **many mitochondria** due to high energy demand.
- **Myofibrils** fill the cell; they are composed of **myofilaments** (actin and myosin).

### Actin and myosin
- Actin (thin filament) and myosin (thick filament) make up ~**90% of muscle protein**.
- Both have ATPase activity: they **hydrolyse ATP → ADP + Pi**, which powers the cross-bridge cycle and force generation.

### Skeletal muscle
- Approximately **640 muscles**, about **40% of body mass**.
- Main role: **body movement** (attached to skeleton via **tendons**).
- **Large, multinucleated cells** (very long fibres).
- **Voluntary** control via somatic motor neurones and reflex activity.
- Can contract **sporadically** (movement) and **continually** (posture).

Hierarchy and coverings:
- **Whole muscle** is wrapped by **epimysium** (dense collagenous sheath).
- **Fascicle** = bundle of muscle fibres; wrapped by **perimysium** (loose collagenous connective tissue).
- **Muscle fibre (myofibre/myocyte)** is surrounded by **endomysium** (delicate connective tissue, mostly collagen).
- These connective tissue layers merge and **form tendons**, attaching muscle to bone and transmitting force to the skeleton.

Key definitions:

- **Fascicle:** grouping of elongated bundles of muscle fibres (cells).
- **Endomysium:** connective tissue separating individual muscle fibres.
- **Perimysium:** surrounds fascicles.
- **Epimysium:** surrounds the entire muscle organ.

### Striations and sarcomeres

- Skeletal muscle is **striated** because of the repeating arrangement of **sarcomeres** within myofibrils.
- Striations arise from **overlapping actin and myosin** in an ordered pattern.
- A **myofibre (myocyte)** contains many myofibrils; myofibrils contain sarcomeres (contractile units).

### Sarcoplasmic reticulum in skeletal muscle (role in Ca²⁺ control)
- SR forms a network around myofibrils and **sequesters Ca²⁺** until contraction is initiated (e.g., neuronal stimulation).

### CARDIAC MUSCLE
- **Involuntary** muscle.
- Cells are **auto-rhythmic**, but activity is coordinated/modulated by the **autonomic nervous system (ANS)**.
- Cells are **branched and interconnected**.
- Contract as a **syncytium** (functional unit), described as “all or nothing”.
### Cardiomyocytes: histological and ultrastructural features
- **Striated** (sarcomeres present).
- Smaller cells (approximately ~100 µm length).
- **1 or 2 nuclei** (uni- or binucleated).
- **Intercalated discs** link cells:
    - **Gap junctions** for electrical coupling.
    - **Desmosomes** for mechanical adhesion (prevent cells pulling apart).
- Very high mitochondrial content (large fraction of cell volume) to resist fatigue; relies on **aerobic respiration** and can use multiple fuel sources.

### Gap junctions
- Gap junctions are formed by **connexons** (each channel with 6 subunits).
- They create **low electrical resistance** pathways and allow diffusion of ions between cells.
- This electrical coupling makes myocardium contract as a coordinated unit.

### SMOOTH MUSCLE
- **Blood vessels:** regulates lumen diameter; contributes to blood pressure maintenance.
- **Digestive tract:** rhythmic peristalsis propels contents.
- **Bladder/urinary tract**, **respiratory tract**, **reproductive tract**, **eyes**, **skin**.

###  Smooth muscle cell features
- Cells are small (~100–200 µm) and **spindle-shaped**, arranged in **sheets**; sheets can be perpendicular to each other (e.g., circular and longitudinal layers).
- **No striations** (no organised sarcomere pattern as in skeletal/cardiac).
- **Single nucleus**.
- **Involuntary** control: influenced by ANS, hormones, and stretch (and local chemicals in the summary table).
- Structural organisation:
    - Actin and myosin are anchored via **dense bodies** throughout the sarcoplasm (functional equivalents of anchoring points).
    - **Gap junctions** electrically connect cells (important for coordinated contraction in many smooth muscles).
    - **Focal adhesions** structurally connect cells (mechanical linkage).
- Contractions are **slower** and can last longer than skeletal/cardiac muscle.

### Summary
- Force generation in all muscle relies on **actin, myosin, ATP, and Ca²⁺**.
- Skeletal muscle organisation is strongly linked to its connective tissue layers: **endo-, peri-, epi-mysium** are not just “wrapping”, they are how force is transmitted to tendons.
- Cardiac muscle acts as a functional syncytium because **intercalated discs** provide both electrical (gap junction) and mechanical (desmosome) coupling.
- Smooth muscle is designed for slow, coordinated, sustained contraction across sheets because of **dense bodies**, gap junctions, and sheet organisation.
