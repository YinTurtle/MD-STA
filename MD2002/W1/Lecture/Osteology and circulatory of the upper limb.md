#upperbody/upperlimbs #muscle 

### LO
- Identify all of the bones and bony landmarks of the upper limb
- Describe the soft tissue features of joints of the upper limb (Capsule and ligaments)
- Describe the arterial supply and venous drainage of the upper limb; including pulses and anastomoses
- Describe the lymphatic drainage of the upper limb and the lymph nodes of the axilla

### Bone Group
- Pectoral girdle: clavicle, scapula
- Arm: humerus
- Forearm: radius, ulna
- Hand: carpals, metacarpals, phalanges

### Clavicle
- Structure
    - S-shaped
    - Smooth superior surface, rough inferior surface
    - Round proximal end, flat + hooked distal end
- Fractured
    - Usually - middle, proximal end goes up, distal end goes down
    - Most commonly fractured bone
        - Takes all the force from UL, and sternoclavicular joint is _very_ strong
- Sternoclavicular joint
    - Very strong ligaments around joint - synovial lined with fibrocartilage
    - Has an articular disc
- Acromioclavicular joint - joins with clavicle

### Sternoclavicular joint
- Very strong ligaments
- Fibrocartilage-lined joint
- Articular disc present
![[Pasted image 20260202001752.png|400]]

### Scapula
- 3 angles - Superior, inferior, lateral
- 3 fossae - supraspinous, infraspinous, subscapular
- 3 borders - medial, lateral, superior
- Suprascapular notch/foramen
![[Pasted image 20260202001912.png]]
- Glenoid fossa (articulates with humeral head)
- Spine (divides posterior surface into supra- and infraspinous fossae)
- Suprascapular notch and the upper transverse scapular ligament, creating the suprascapular foramen

### Humerus

##### Proximal
- Head - articulating bit
- Two necks - anatomical neck and surgical neck - anatomical is "true" neck, surgical neck is where we expect the neck to usually be
- Two tubercles - bumps
- Tuberosity - long, rough sites of attachment for muscles
![[Pasted image 20260202002222.png|350]]

###### Glenohumeral joint
Capsule/ligaments
- Capsule is thickened by ligaments but overall is relatively lax
- Three glenohumeral ligaments: superior, middle, inferior
- Coracohumeral ligament
- Transverse humeral ligament
- Long head of biceps runs intracapsular/related to the supraglenoid region (shown as a key structure).
![[Pasted image 20260202002609.png|300]] ![[Pasted image 20260202002643.png|300]]

Bursae (important for pain patterns)
- Subacromial (subdeltoid; SASD) bursa
- Subscapular bursa - extension of the joint capsule itself - can get inflamed if joint capsule gets inflamed
- Others named: subcoracoid, coracobrachial
![[Pasted image 20260202002725.png|400]]

##### Fractures
- Surgical neck: axillary nerve 
- Mid-shaft: spiral groove - radial nerve
- Supracondylar region: median nerve
![[Pasted image 20260202003834.png|300]]

##### Distal
![[Pasted image 20260202004143.png]]

### Forearm
- Syndesmosis - fibrous joint

##### Proximal Ulna
- Olecranon process - goes into olecranon fossa on humerus
- Coronoid process - goes into coronoid fossa on humerus
- Radial notch - where the radius articulates
![[Pasted image 20260202004246.png]]

##### Proximal Radius
- Circular head
- Articulates with capitulum of humerus
![[Pasted image 20260202004355.png]]

##### Elbow
Elbow is presented as a complex joint:
- Humeroulnar joint
- Humeroradial joint
- Shares a capsule with proximal radioulnar joint
![[Pasted image 20260202004737.png|300]]

Soft tissues:
- Annular ligament - pulls radius towards ulna
- Collateral ligaments holds radius and ulna to humerus
![[Pasted image 20260202004834.png]]
![[Pasted image 20260202005029.png]]

Bursae:
- Named after muscles that they are around
- Olecranon bursae - bursae at tip of elbow
	- Deep intratendinous bursa
    - Superficial subcutaneous bursa
![[Pasted image 20260202005218.png]]

##### Colles' Fracture
- Fractured distal radius + displacement
![[Pasted image 20260202005749.png|200]]![[Pasted image 20260202005807.png|300]]

##### Distal radioulnar joint
- “Middle radioulnar joint” described as a syndesmosis (fibrous joint)
- Distal radioulnar joint includes a fibrous disc
- Anterior/posterior radioulnar ligaments described as weak
- Synovial membrane + sacciform recess (aiding movement)
![[Pasted image 20260202005924.png]]

Movement:
- Ulna is the one moving during pronation and supination
 ![[Pasted image 20260202010121.png]]

### Hand bones
- 27 bones
- 14 phalanges - long bone
- 5 metacarpals - long bone
- 8 carpals - short bone
![[Pasted image 20260202010300.png|300]]

##### Carpals
- Proximal and distal rows
- SLTP, TTCH
- Proximal Row
    - S – Scaphoid
    - L – Lunate
    - T – Triquetrum
    - (P – Pisiform) <- sesamoid
- Distal Row
    - Tz – Trapezium
    - Td – Trapezoid
    - C – Capitate
    - H – Hammate
![[Pasted image 20260202010446.png|400]]

###### Carpal joint
- Intercarpal joints: plane joints, sliding movement
- Midcarpal joint: between rows; contributes to abduction/extension
- Pisotriquetral joint - joint bt pisiform and triquetrum
- 1st CMC: saddle joint (thumb); 2–5 CMC: condyloid joints
- Capsule continuity with CMC joints (not 1st CMC); clinical note about spread of infection; many small unnamed ligaments

###### Carpal Tunnel
- Carpal bones form a carpal arch
- Flexor retinaculum forms the roof
- Attachments:
    - Medial: hook of hamate, pisiform
    - Lateral: tubercle of trapezium, scaphoid
![[Pasted image 20260202011009.png|350]]
![[Pasted image 20260202011739.png|550]]
##### Radioulnar joint
- Ulna does not directly take part
- Separated by fibrocartilage disc
- Palmar/dorsal radiocarpal ligaments
- Palmar ulnocarpal ligament
- Radial/ulnar collateral ligaments

##### Joints in the hand
- 1st CMC: saddle joint, separate from other CMC joints
- MCP: condylar joint with collateral and palmar ligaments
- IP: hinge joints with collateral and palmar ligaments
- Intermetacarpal joints continuous with CMC joints (palmar, dorsal, interosseous ligaments)

###### Movement of digits
- IP: flexion/extension
- MCP: flexion/extension + abduction/adduction
- Middle finger is axis for abduction/adduction
- Thumb is “special” (because of 1st CMC mechanics)
![[Pasted image 20260202012252.png]]

### Arteries
- Subclavian arteries: origin differences right vs left (brachiocephalic trunk vs aortic arch)
- Becomes axillary artery at lateral border of 1st rib
- Two relevant branches named: dorsal scapular, suprascapular

#### Axillary Arteries
- 1st before Pec. minor
    - Superior thoracic artery - supplies intercostal spaces of ribs 1 and 2
- 2nd behind Pec minor
    - Thoraco-acromial artery - "pokes up behind pec minor and goes blegh :P"
    - Lateral thoracic artery - Moves down the lateral thorax along the mid-axillary line, supplies the lateral and anterior thoracic wall + lateral aspect of the breast
- 3rd after Pec. minor
    - Subscapular artery - "chonky", branches -> thoraco-dorsal artery (supplies the post. thoracic wall), circumflex scapular artery (goes around the scapula)
    - Ant./Post. circumflex humeral artery - go around the humerus, form an anastamosis
- "Screw The Lawyer, Save A Pigeon"
![[Pasted image 20260202013032.png]]

#### Brachial Artery
- Starts at lower border of teres major
- Ends when it bifurcates anterior to the elbow (exact location varies)
- 3 branches
    - Profunda Barachii (profound - deep)
    - Superior Ulnar collateral
    - Inferior Ulnar Collateral
![[Pasted image 20260202013352.png|500]]

#### Radial and Ulnar
- Variable bifurcation
- Ulnar larger/deeper than radial - more difficult to palpate, so we use the radial
- Radial/ulnar recurrent branches - go back "up" the arm and anastomosise with the sup./inf. ulnar collateral arteries
- Radial artery starts anterior in the forearm, but "dips" down into the wrist and enters the hand posteriorly
    - Passes by the anatomical snuffbox
- Ulnar artery remains anterior when entering the hand

##### Interosseous Arteries
- Ulnar artery quickly branches off deep as the common interosseous artery -> Anterior interosseous + Posterior interosseous (runs down the ant./post. sides of the interosseous membrane, supplying the ant./post. compartments of muscles)

#### The Wrist
- Neither radial/ulnar enter carpal tunnel - radial passes posteriorly to the carpal bones, ulnar passes anteriorly (superficially) through Guyon's Canal
    - Allen's Test - testing for flow through the anastamoses - compress both arteries, palm goes pale, release one artery at a time, check if palm goes back to being pink
    - Each one gives a palmar and dorsal carpal branch (4 in total), connect up to form dorsal/palmar carpal arches
- Scaphoid fractures
    - Easily fractured
    - Scaphoid gets blood supply from distal end - if fractured, can cause avascular necrosis
