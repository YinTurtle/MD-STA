### Excitation contraction coupling
Linkage between electrical signals of the muscle fibre and the onset of contraction. Converting that electrical signal to a mechanical process.

### Neuromuscular junction
![[Pasted image 20260210161001.png]]
- AP deliver down to the motor neurone (depolarisation)
- Cause activation of voltage-gated calcium channels
- Calcium flows into motor neurone and fuses with pre synaptic vesicles
- That fusion enables vesicles to fuse with membrane to release the contents (ACh)
- ACh can defuse across synaptic cleft (because its only 20nm) to skeletal muscle fibre
- At motor end plate, there is ligand gated channels (called nicotinic receptor)
	- The ACh is the ligand here, binds to receptors, it opens, then potassium flows out and sodium flows in (this causes depolarisation - this is called motor end plate potential)
		- Motor end plate - the specific part of the muscle cell where the neuron interfaces

### Skeletal Muscle
#### Action Potential
![[Pasted image 20260210161538.png]]
- Skeletal muscle potential is very short (~10ms)
- On the graph
	- First line = resting membrane potential
	- Ascending gradient = Threshold potential (depolarisation - this causes membrane potential to become more positive)
	- Peak = peak potential
	- Then repolarisation
#### Tension Response
![[Pasted image 20260210161954.png]]
- Tension response doesn't overlap action potential
- The latent period
	- Peak action potential and onset of contraction
##### Latent period
- Exists because depolarisation needs to be transmitted from the sarcolemma to all the muscle cells
- During this time, the muscle is preparing to generate tension as Ca2+ binds to troponin, causing tropomyosin to shift away from actin-binding sites, and cross-bridges to form, leading to sarcomere shortening

#### Role of transverse tubule
![[Pasted image 20260210163317.png]]

##### Depolarisation of the muscle fibre
![[Pasted image 20260210163345.png]]
![[Pasted image 20260210165155.png]]
- When depolarisation of the motor end plate happen
	- AP is being delivered down to the T-tubule
	- It is sensed by voltage gated calcium channel within the triad
		- Protein that senses the change in membrane potential, is a L-type calcium channel, known as DHP receptor (dihydropyridine receptor)
		- DHP senses change - leads to confirmation change
			- Allows it to mechanical coupling with RyR1 - causing it to open. 
				- As it opens, calcium flows down conc gradient from [[Sarcomere Structure#Sarcoplasmic Reticulum]] to cytosol
				- This calcium can bind to troponin-C
					- Will then alter its confirmation to allow actin and myosin filament to slide over each other which causes contraction

###### Remember:
- influx of sodium causes depolarisation (more positive membrane potential)
- deliverance of AP is through t-tubules
- [[Sarcomere Structure#T-tubules]] is between 2 terminal cisternae (part of SR - forming a triad)
	- because they are close, when DHP receptor sense membrane potential change and alter confirmation change - can directly couple with RyR1 - making it open, calcium flows down conc gradient
		- the calcium initiates the contraction

### Calcium
- Recycled between 2 intracellular compartments
	- stored in SR
	- released into cytoplasm during contraction
	- shuttled back into SR during relaxation

#### Key diff between Skeletal muscle and Cardiac muscle
No requirement for extracellular calcium to initiate the contraction response. Calcium comes from intracellular store. Mechanical coupling between DHP receptor and RyR1 initiates release of calcium from the store ([[Sarcomere Structure#Sarcoplasmic Reticulum]])

#### Mechanism of Calcium release
Junctional foot proteins
##### Dihydropyridine protein receptor (DHPR)
L-type voltage-gated calcium channel in the T-tubule membrane
##### Ryanodine receptor protein (RYR)
Calcium release channel in the SR

#### Release of calcium
- The open calcium channels allow calcium to diffuse down a steep concentration gradient into the cytoplasm
- Cytoplasmic calcium concentration increases from < 10^-7 M to > 10^-5 M
- The increase in intracellular calcium concentration is the KEY event which ultimately leads to force generation through the interaction of actin and myosin filaments

### Relaxation
Repolarisation - SERCA brings calcium back into the SR (forcing calcium into the store - low conc gradient to high conc gradient)
- SERCA is an ATPase - meaning it needs energy (hydrolyses ATP)
##### SERCA
**S**arcoplasmic **E**ndoplasmic **R**eticulum **C**alcium **A**TPase
##### Calsequestrin
- Stores calcium at high concentrations in the terminal cisternae to establish a concentration gradient from the SR to the cytoplasm
	- Calcium binding protein
	- Binds 43 calcium ions per molecule
	- [think of a mop, it mops up the free calcium, making it less of a gradient (due to less free calcium), release calcium when calcium store is low, mops additional calcium when there is excess free calcium]

### Pathologies
#### [[Malignant Hyperthermia]]
- Genetic disorder caused by mutation in RyR1
- Severe reaction to commonly used anaesthetics and depolarising muscle relaxants
- Fatal if untreated
##### Symptoms
- Muscle rigidity (unable to relax due to constant elevation of calcium)
- Rapid Breathing
- High Fever
- Hyperthermia (rising body temperature) – patient's temperature may rise as rapidly as 1°C every 5 minutes (since SERCA is constantly trying to remove the calcium, it uses ATP, causing temp to rise)
- Rapid heart rate
- Increased CO 2 production
##### If left untreated
- Lactic acidosis
- Hyperkalaemia – due to breakdown of muscle tissue leading to release of K+) Increased acid levels in blood and other tissues
##### Underlying mechanism
- Point mutations in the gene coding for RyR1 - increases the probability that the Ca2+ release channel will be open
- Abnormal regulation of muscle contraction
- Increase in metabolic rate - Excessive ATP hydrolysis to provide energy for contraction
- Increased rate of ATP hydrolysis leading to increased metabolic rate (as muscle tries to replenish and to sustain its ATP stores)
- Hyperthermia develops because of the heat liberated by the hydrolysis of AT
##### Treatment
- Intravenous administration of the drug dantrolene
- Cessation of anaesthesia
- Aggressive efforts aimed at cooling the body

### Cardiac Muscle
Doesn't need to be innervated to contract
- Has specialised cells called **Pacemaker cells**
- Intrinsic rhythm
![[Pasted image 20260210172621.png]]
SA node -> electrical signal propagated to atria and AV node -> ventricle

#### Autonomic Innervation of Cardiac muscle
![[Pasted image 20260210172750.png]]
#### Cardiac muscle
##### Action potential
![[Pasted image 20260210173045.png]]
- Resting membrane potential (~-90mV)
- Reach threshold when information is received from SA node being propagated down to ventricles
- Then rapid depolarisation through sodium channels. (sec10msec)
- Then partial repolarisation
	- Activation of voltage gated calcium channels (~60msec) to allow calcium to flow in
- Repolarisation by potassium channels (~250msec)
##### Tension Response
![[Pasted image 20260210173403.png]]
- Comparing with skeletal muscle, tension contraction occurs during AP in cardiac muscle

#### Ca2+ induced Ca2+ release (CICR)
- Calcium flows through DHP channel -> which then triggers RyR2 to release the rest of calcium from stores
- Requires extracellular calcium - ~25% from outside to induce CICR
![[Pasted image 20260210173905.png]]
##### Relaxation
- Calcium ATPase in SR pumps calcium back into the SR, same happens in the cell membrane (sodium/calcium exchange pump (sodium in calcium out), Na:Ca = 3:1)
	- Too much sodium may cause depolarisation, so sodium/potassium ATPase pumps sodium out and potassium in (overall repolarises the tissue) (Na:K - 3:2, for every 1 ATP molecule hydrolyzed)
- 75% of calcium is pumped out of the cell, 25% back into the SR
- If excitation contraction process is disrupted and there is a imbalance, this will cause an arrhythmia
#### Pathology
- One type of arrythmia - Too much Ca is being pumped out -> too much Na inside the cell Na/K pump can't cope with so much Na -> leads to depolarisation
- RyR2 channelopathy
	- Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) - inheritable dominant condition - ventricular tachycardia during stress/exercise
	- Symptoms - dizzy spells, fainting episodes, sudden cardiac death
	- Problem - 69 different point mutations identified when trying to screen for CPVT
