### LO
- What causes malignant hyperthermia?
- What are the signs and symptoms of malignant hyperthermia?
- What medical interventions are used to treat malignant hyperthermia?

### Causes
- **Core cause:** a **genetic disorder of skeletal muscle excitation–contraction (EC) coupling** → abnormal control of Ca²⁺ release from the [[Sarcomere Structure#Sarcoplasmic Reticulum]].
- **Typical trigger:** exposure to certain anaesthetic drugs, especially **volatile inhalational agents (e.g., halothane)** and **succinylcholine**.
- **Main mechanism:**  
    The **ryanodine receptor (RyR1)** is like a **leaky SR “calcium valve.”**  
    When triggered, it opens too easily → **excess Ca²⁺ floods the muscle** → continuous contraction + massive ATP use → **hypermetabolic state**.
- **Genetics:** usually **autosomal dominant** inheritance.
    - Many cases linked to mutations in **RYR1 (chromosome 19)**.
    - Some families are **not linked to RYR1**, suggesting other EC-coupling pathway defects can cause similar phenotype.
- **Related conditions:**
    - Some muscular dystrophies can have MH-like crises under anaesthesia.
    - **Neuroleptic malignant syndrome** is similar clinically but due to **abnormally high neuronal input** (not the same mechanism).

### Sign & Symptoms
**Typical onset:** usually **during anaesthesia**, but can occur **hours later**.
#### Early / operating room clues
- Tachypnoea
- Low plasma O₂
- High plasma CO₂ (hypercapnia)
- Tachycardia
- Rapidly rising temperature (can rise **~1°C every 5 minutes**)
- Muscle rigidity
- Sweating
- Marked blood pressure instability (dramatic swings)
#### Progression if untreated
- Hypermetabolic state in muscle → excessive ATP hydrolysis → heat production
- Respiratory + lactic acidosis
- Rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown)
    - releases K⁺ → severe hyperkalaemia (dangerous arrhythmia risk)
    - releases myoglobin → kidney injury risk

### Medical Interventions
1. Stop triggering agents
    - Cessation of anaesthesia (remove volatile agent / stop succinylcholine exposure)
2. Give dantrolene
    - Main antidote: **blocks EC coupling between T-tubules and SR**, interrupting uncontrolled contraction.
    - Can be used **acutely** to abort an episode, and **prophylactically** in known at-risk patients before anaesthesia.
3. Aggressive cooling
    - Actively reduce body temperature.

#### Supportive management (treat consequences)
- IV hydration + diuretics to maintain urine output
    - protects kidneys from **myoglobin** and other breakdown products.
- Sodium bicarbonate for lactic acidosis
- Mechanical hyperventilation to blow off excess CO₂
#### Aftercare/prevention
- Screen relatives (autosomal dominant pattern)
- Some affected relatives may have **raised baseline CK** (creatine kinase)

### Summary
#### What causes MH?
- Inherited (autosomal dominant) skeletal muscle disorder (often **RYR1** mutation)
- Triggered by **volatile inhalational anaesthetics** (e.g., halothane) and **succinylcholine**
- RyR1 Ca²⁺ channel opens too easily → Ca²⁺ floods muscle → sustained contraction + massive ATP use → hypermetabolic heat production
#### Signs & symptoms
- **Rising CO₂** (high plasma CO₂) + **tachypnoea**
- **Tachycardia**
- **Rapid hyperthermia** (temp can rise very fast)
- **Muscle rigidity**, sweating, BP swings
- If untreated: **acidosis**, **rhabdomyolysis → hyperkalaemia**, myoglobin → kidney injury
#### Treatment
- **Stop triggering anaesthetics**
- **Give dantrolene**
- **Active cooling**
- Support: **hyperventilate**, **IV fluids + diuretics**, **bicarbonate for acidosis**
